@1 = ~Aran Linvail's daughter has been abducted

   Aran wants me to rescue his daughter Abagail and won't help me any further until that task is completed. His spies have reported that they think she is somewhere north of the Balthis Estate in the Bridge District. I guess I will take a look around there.~
@2 = ~Aran Linvail's daughter has been abducted

   I found Abagail, and she seems to be in good health, given the circumstances. I should return her to her father now.~
@3 = ~Aran Linvail's Daughter has been abducted

   I had an uneasy feeling about Abagail and decided to slay her. She fell quickly enough to my attack. Perhaps that was a mistake in judgment. I can't tell Aran that I slaughtered his daughter though...~
@4 = ~Aran Linvail's Daughter has been abducted

   I had an uneasy feeling about Abagail and decided to slay her. I'm glad I did, because she was a vampire! She turned to mist and floated away, but at least I didn't deliver her to Aran Linvail. Now to tell him about his daughter's fate...~
@5 = ~Aran Linvail's Daughter has been abducted

   Abagail gave me a lump of glowing metal alloy for rescuing her. I get the feeling that I should hold onto it. Perhaps with an item to focus its power it would make for a powerful weapon if forged.~
@6 = ~Aran Linvail's Daughter has been abducted

   I told Aran about how Abagail was a vampire. I feel sorry for him, but what can you do? I can only avenge her now.~
@7 = ~Aran Linvail's Daughter has been abducted

   Aran seems to have bought the excuse that Abagail was already dead. Thank goodness, I was afraid Aran would withhold his aid because of our failure. Only thing left to do now is slaughter Bodhi.~
@8    = ~We are all happy for you, Sir Anomen. But why are you looking at <CHARNAME> in that manner? You couldn't possibly think that she is interested in you on a personal level, could you?~
@9    = ~Of course she is, my lady barbarian. What woman wouldn't be interested in such as me, with my chiseled good looks, my righteous attitude, my charming personality... ah... save yourself, of course, my lady Yr'kai.~
@10   = ~Fine, we'll settle this now then. Back off, or be put down.~
@11   = ~I say, good lady! You wish to duel for the hand of <CHARNAME>!? Present arms then, and prepare to taste the ground, wench!~
@12   = ~Though I would love nothing better than to thoroughly defeat and humiliate you, Anomen, perhaps we should let <CHARNAME> decide between us. It is her decision, after all.~
@13   = ~Quite right, good lady. Then when she chooses me, you shall stand aside or else... <CHARNAME>?~
@14   = ~You're both sweet but my heart belongs to Anomen. I apologize, Chloe, for leading you to believe otherwise.~
@15   = ~I am flattered by your attentions, but my heart belongs to Chloe. Please do not fight over me, Anomen.~
@16   = ~Actually... If I can't have both of you I don't want either one of you. I can't choose between you, but I do not wish you to fight for me either. I'm sorry.~
@17   = ~What do you think... me... Chloe... Anomen... one big happy family... (Smile)~
@18   = ~I see. I wish you two the best of luck then. In the meantime, I shall ponder on whether your sanity is still intact. Please continue your conversation whilst I vomit.~
@19   = ~Ah, yes. Before I was interrupted, I was saying that I am grateful for your assistance, my lady.~
@20   = ~Ah... I... ah... as you wish, my lady. I shall bow out and refrain from my flirtatious advances henceforth.~
@21   = ~Thank you, Anomen.~
@22   = ~My lady! I... I see. This is most distressing, but I see I cannot change your mind on the matter. Perhaps it is for the best.~
@23   = ~That certainly didn't go as I had planned... ah well. I must honor your wishes, <CHARNAME>.~
@24   = ~Now is not the time to jest, my lady! Though perhaps...~
@25   = ~Don't even look at me like that, Anomen. I want no part in this. Unless... Imoen is rather cute. And four is such a better number than three... Anomen, you're drooling.~
@26   = ~Ewww!!!! My face is up here, Anomen!~
@27   = ~Ah... terribly sorry. However tempting that thought is, the Order would never allow it. I must bow out of this relationship altogether, as I see where it shall lead me. My apologies, <CHARNAME>.~
@28   = ~Surprising. Now then, where does that leave us, <CHARNAME>?~
@29   = ~You and I in a loving relationship, of course.~
@30   = ~We'll talk about it later... when Imoen is present. (Grin)~
@31   = ~Perhaps we should ask Imoen...~
@32   = ~Sorry, if I can't have you both I don't want either one of you, Chloe.~
@33   = ~Excellent. (Grin)~
@34   = ~Damn, so that's what happened to all my faerie dust. Strange effects... you both should feel better after a night's sleep.~
@35   = ~Though I am happy you feel that way, Anomen, I've noticed your gaze upon <CHARNAME> has changed since your Test. And I do not like it.~
@36   = ~Is that so, my lady barbarian? I shall look upon her in any manner I wish. I believe she should decide for herself whose attention she wishes to receive, however. And I want you to hear it from her lips when she tells you to leave her be.~
@37   = ~Agreed then. <CHARNAME>, which of us shall it be?~
@38   = ~Anomen, of course. I must follow my heart, after all.~
@39   = ~My apologies, Anomen. But if I must choose, I choose Chloe.~
@40   = ~I cannot choose between you two! That is unfair of you to ask. Therefore, I choose neither.~
@41   = ~Can't I keep you both? (Grin)~
@42   = ~I see. As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I will not bother you with my flirtations again.~
@43   = ~Now that this matter has been settled, I was speaking on the matter of those ignorant fools of the order...~
@44   = ~Ah... I see. If that is how you feel, then I will stay out of your affairs.~
@45   = ~Perhaps that is for the best, then. If you're this indecisive then I wouldn't want any part of you anyway, wench!~
@46   = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@47   = ~Perhaps there is hope for you surfacers yet.~
@48   = ~That could be arranged, I should think...~
@49   = ~Eeew! Quit drooling on me, Anomen! I want no part in this.~
@50   = ~Ah... just you and me then, <CHARNAME>?~
@51   = ~Of course, Anomen. Now, what were you saying?~
@52   = ~As I said, I wanted you both. If I can't have you both, I don't want either. Sorry, Anomen.~
@53   = ~Nowhere, Anomen. Leave me be.~
@54   = ~Yes of course, I was talking about those fools of the Order.~
@55   = ~Greedy bitch! Fine then, have it your way.~
@56   = ~Greetings, my daughter. I see you have managed to get yourself into quite a bind here.~
@57   = ~Mother? Why... why are you here?~
@58   = ~To warn you, child. Your skills will not be enough to see you through the trials ahead.~
@59   = ~My skills are more than adequate. I have not trained my whole life for nothing. I will be fine.~
@60   = ~No, my darling daughter. You will die. And your new friends will die with you.~
@61   = ~Then leave us to our fate, mother. You should have more confidence in me.~
@62   = ~Silly girl, I was not pronouncing your death. I was merely giving you a warning. I will give you some of my strength.~
@63   = ~With it, you can better stand the tribulations ahead.~
@64   = ~I refuse.~
@65   = ~Excuse me?~
@66   = ~I fight with my own skill and need no divine protection.~
@67   = ~Chloe, you have mastered your current weapons. I simply wish to add more of my power to them.~
@68   = ~Must I repeat myself?~
@69   = ~Stubborn girl. Simply having a more powerful weapon does not take away from your skill. In fact, you must be extremely skilled to use the weapons.~
@70   = ~And you must master the new powers of your weapons, just as you mastered your old weapons. I will grant them my power. It is your choice as to whether you use them or not. Fare thee well, my child.~
@71   = ~Those bastards abducted my daughter in their attack. They are using her to blackmail me into not attacking and destroying their guild once and for all.~
@72   = ~Abagail was abducted AGAIN?! By the gods, Aran, can you not watch over your poor daughter?~
@73   = ~The Shadow Thieves have already been severely weakened. I had not thought that any outsiders save yourself even knew she was my daughter.~
@74   = ~The Shadow Thieves have already been severely weakened. I had not thought that any outsiders even knew she was my daughter.~
@75   = ~But then, it is Shadow Thieves that are leaving to join Bodhi's guild, so that is probably how they learned of poor sweet Abagail. Please, you must rescue her! Once she is returned to me, speak with me again to prepare for the final destruction of that bitch's guild. My scouts inform me that she was taken into the Bridge, somewhere north of the Balthis Estate.~
@76   = ~I don't see how we have much choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@77   = ~Intruders! Destroy them quickly, my childer!~
@78   = ~Oh, Chloe! It's so good to see you again! You're here to rescue me, right? Please take me to my father!~
@79   = ~Oh! Who are you, did you slay the vampires? You're here to rescue me, right? I was so scared... but I knew my father would send someone, please take me to him!~
@80   = ~Of course, Abagail.~
@81   = ~I don't trust you...~
@82   = ~I won't fall for that trick, DIE!~
@83   = ~Of course, Abagail. <CHARNAME>, it's her. We should hurry back.~
@84   = ~Yes. Come with us, Abagail.~
@85   = ~<CHARNAME>! What's wrong with you?!~
@86   = ~This is Abagail, <CHARNAME>. I recognize her.~
@87   = ~Eek!~
@88   = ~Please, please take me to my father.~
@89   = ~Alright... let's go.~
@90   = ~I'm not so sure. I'll decide later.~
@91   = ~Oh, are you here to rescue me? Please, take me to my father at once! I am so frightened.~
@92   = ~What are you waiting for? I beg of you, please take me to my father.~ [NOSOUND]
@93   = ~What is there to decide? Please, I beg of you, take me to my father...~ [NOSOUND]
@94   = ~Thank the gods you've returned. Abagail, I was so worried!~
@95   = ~Oh father, I was so scared! Thank you for sending a rescue!~
@96   = ~I am overjoyed at my daughter's safe return, thank you once again.~
@97   = ~Chloe, <CHARNAME>, I want to show my appreciation for my rescue. Here, I've been holding this metal for a while now. I'm not sure where it's from or what it is for, but it's glowing so I think it'll be of benefit to you. I hope you can find a use for it!~
@98   = ~Now, to the matter of finally destroying Bodhi's guild once and for all! Once they are dead we will be free to send you on your way to rescue your companion and slay the mage or what have you.~
@99   = ~You return! Where... where is my daughter? Your faces are grim... it can only be bad news.~
@100  = ~I am sorry, Aran. Abagail was turned by the vampire scum. She turned to mist before our very eyes. My condolences.~
@101  = ~Thank you... this is a dark day indeed. Oh... my poor daughter. (Sigh) I will grieve once she is avenged. It is now time for you to slaughter that bitch Bodhi for what she has done!~
@102  = ~You return... but where is my daughter? You look... guilty.~
@103  = ~I am sorry, Aran. She was already dead when we got there. My deepest condolences.~
@104  = ~Well, what have you to report? Did you find Abagail or not?~
@105  = ~We have not yet found her.~
@106  = ~Then stop dawdling around here and get going! Abagail must be found! I will not help you any further until my daughter has been rescued!~
@107  = ~It's nice to see you again. Did you wish to speak to be about something?~ [NOSOUND]
@108  = ~Yes, how have you been doing, Abby?~
@109  = ~Yes, could you perhaps tell me a little more about this metal you gave me?~
@110  = ~Yes, do you think we can trust your father?~
@111  = ~No, I was just checking up on you.~
@112  = ~I've been having bad dreams about those vampires, but I am well enough. Thank you again for rescuing me.~
@113  = ~Could you perhaps tell me a little more about this metal you gave me?~
@114  = ~Do you think we can trust your father?~
@115  = ~Think nothing of it. Be well.~
@116  = ~I found it in a crater in the ground, I believe it fell out of the sky. Beyond that, nothing that you can't know by looking at it yourself.~
@117  = ~How have you been doing, Abby?~
@118  = ~Alright, thanks.~
@119  = ~When my father makes a promise, he keeps it. You don't keep a position such as his without being honorable with those you deal with. So yes, if he says he will help you, then he will help you.~
@120  = ~I certainly hope so. Good bye...~
@121  = ~Ok, fair enough.~
@122  = ~Chloe, lovely to see you as always. Have you come to visit with me?~
@123  = ~Yes. How have you been?~
@124  = ~As well as can be expected. I don't think I'll get over my ordeal for some time.~
@125  = ~I understand. You take care of yourself, cutie. I don't want to have to rescue you for a third time.~
@126  = ~I shall try. Thank you, Chloe.~
@127  = ~Come to see me again, Chloe? And I thought I was the one with the crush.~
@128  = ~Ah, you know me, Abby. I have a crush on all the pretty girls.~
@129  = ~*Blush* You shouldn't tease, Chloe! But thank you.~
@130  = ~I'm doing well, Chloe. You needn't be concerned, but thank you anyway.~
@131  = ~I can't help but be concerned. You still owe me that home cooked meal you promised, you know.~
@132  = ~Soon! I promise. Thanks for visiting me!~
@133  = ~Leave me be, I am not feeling well.~
@134  = ~I am sorry to hear that. Is there anything I could do to make you feel better?~
@135  = ~Could you tell me anything about this metal alloy you gave me?~
@136  = ~Do you think that we could trust your father to fulfill his end of the bargain?~
@137  = ~All right then, I will leave you alone.~
@138  = ~(Looks at you for a moment, hunger in her eye. She blinks and the look is gone)~
@139  = ~No thank you. Just leave me be.~
@140  = ~It's a glowing metal lump. What more can I say about it? Leave me be.~
@141  = ~No, he will likely have you killed. Perhaps you should kill him first? Yes... I think that is an excellent idea...~
@142  = ~I did not realize you were at such odds with your father. Understandable I suppose, given his ineptitude at keeping you safe.~
@143  = ~Yes, and if you come back, bring me a gift. A small furry animal perhaps... or a succulent baby.~
@144  = ~Say what? A baby!?~
@145  = ~Did I say baby? I am tired and addled, forgive me. So thirsty...~
@146  = ~Blasted thieves! This had better not come out of my pay. You face a Yr'kai kensai now, you pile of rocks!~ [NOSOUND]
@147  = ~If you're a friend, feel free to help me destroy this mindless toy. If you're in league with these monsters, then I'll deal with you next.~ [NOSOUND]
@148  = ~We'll help you out, not to worry.~
@149  = ~We're escaping from here. Sorry, but we have no time to help you. Good luck.~
@150  = ~We'll slay you AND the golem! Have at you!~
@151  = ~Well, another dead golem. Now, if you are not in league with the master of this guild, may I ask who you are?~ [NOSOUND]
@152  = ~To introduce myself, I am Chloe of the Yr'kai tribe. And you are?~
@153  = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I was captured by the wizard who is master here, and now I escape his damnable dungeon.~
@154  = ~Pleased to meet you, <CHARNAME>. I was hired by the Shadow Thieves to aid in the routing of this new rival guild. It seems we're on the same side. Would you like me to join you, or shall we go our seperate ways?~
@155  = ~I would be pleased to have you join me. Your fighting skills will be quite useful. Let us continue on, then.~
@156  = ~I think it best we go our seperate ways for now, I'm afraid. Perhaps we shall meet again someday.~
@157  = ~Alright, fair enough. Should we both survive our egress, you may find me in a nearby inn called the Den of the Seven Vales. Or I may be out and about if I've been hired for another task. We shall see. Good journey to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@158  = ~Well, another dead golem. Now, you say you are not my enemy but you seem unwilling to aid me. Are you truly not in league with the guildmaster of this place, or were you just waiting your turn to attack me?~ [NOSOUND]
@159  = ~We are not enemies. I am escaping from this place. I would have you join me, if you are not opposed to such.~
@160  = ~Though we are not enemies, we are not allies either. I think it best we go our seperate ways.~
@161  = ~Hmph. So you were observing my skills, I see? Alright, I shall join you for now. Don't be surprised if I leave the party should you decide to continue sitting back on your laurels and watching me do all the work, however.~
@162  = ~Hello again. Looks like you survived.~ [NOSOUND]
@163  = ~Um, yes, I did. We had more chances if we went separate ways. Would you join the group now we are out of that dungeon?~
@164  = ~You said you are a mercenary. I have come to hire your services.~
@165  = ~It seems you survived, too. Good then, farewell... I'll come back if I ever need your assistance.~
@166  = ~Who are you? You seem familiar to me...~
@167  = ~Only because I had to slay you! On guard!!~
@168  = ~Well if it isn't my "good friend", bothering me AGAIN. What do you want now?~ [NOSOUND]
@169  = ~Would you join the group now?~
@170  = ~Eh... I'll come back if I ever need your assistance.~
@171  = ~I've come to end your sorry life! On guard!!~
@172  = ~Oh, very well then. Those are the words I like to hear. Now... what for?~
@173  = ~I must rescue my childhood friend, Imoen. She is being held prisoner by the Cowled Wizards.~
@174  = ~I am after a mage named Irenicus. He is the one you were looking for in the underground complex, by the way. He was made prisoner by the Cowled Wizards.~
@175  = ~I need all the help I can get. I'm an adventurer, and you are a skilled warrior whose abilities I would appreciate in the group.~
@176  = ~Actually, forget about it... I will come back if I need you.~
@177  = ~That depends. Would you be so kind as to refresh my memory and tell me of your goals again? If it's no bother to you... "friend".~
@178  = ~I need all the help I can get. You are a skilled warrior whose abilities I would appreciate in the group.~
@179  = ~(Raises an eyebrow) If you are that eager to die...~
@180  = ~(Frowns) You have quite a forgetful mind it seems. We met in the underground complex beneath the Waukeen promenade. I was in the middle of a fight with a golem, do you remember now? I told you we could meet here if we both escaped, and if I wasn't in a new job. Which (grin) obviously, I don't have at the moment.~
@181  = ~Oh! Oh yes, yes... so, would you join the group now we are out of that dungeon?~
@182  = ~Uhm, of course, I was just... testing you. I have come to hire your services.~
@183  = ~Not a clue. Sorry to bother you... maybe I'll come back if I find I need you.~
@184  = ~Yes, I remember you. Very well then, I'll be back if I am in need of your assistance.~
@185  = ~Ah-ha! I was sure it was you, now prepare to be slain!!~
@186  = ~(Narrows eyes) I am a mercenary, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Probably I will be on another job by the time you come back. But if I am, be sure you have with you a good amount of coins, because no mercenary works for free.~
@187  = ~What for?~
@188  = ~An adventurer? (Chuckle) So you go all around Faerun doing errands for people and solving quests? How... typical.~
@189  = ~The Cowled Wizards? That is aiming quite high. They are a powerful organization, and having them as enemies would be dangerous. Very dangerous.~
@190  = ~(Deepens her scowl menacingly) better if you don't come back then. For your own good.~
@191  = ~Hmmm... actually, I have some issues to settle with this... Irenicus you speak about. I am curious about him, he must be very powerful to have a small demi-plane of air embedded in his dungeon.~
@192  = ~Very well, I shall join forces with you. No fee at all... that means I do not work for you. Have that always in mind.~
@193  = ~Your name was...~
@194  = ~<CHARNAME>. Pleased to have you in the group.~
@195  = ~<CHARNAME>. Don't you ever forget it.~
@196  = ~None of your business.~
@197  = ~Chloe, of the Yr'Kai tribe. Let's go, then.~
@198  = ~(Grin) Chloe, of the Yr'Kai tribe. See? It wasn't that difficult. Let's go, then.~
@199  = ~Oh, nothing of my business, it is? I see. Well, maybe I should reconsider joining your group. I just changed my mind, actually. One thousand gold pieces, and your name, or there is no deal.~
@200  = ~Please, I misspoke... my name is <CHARNAME>, forgive my rudeness, it's just that I'm used to hiding my identity... I am sorry, please join me. It won't happen again.~
@201  = ~Hmpf... very well, here is the money. Join and let's get going. And my name is <CHARNAME>.~
@202  = ~And actually, I changed my mind too, now. I'm not interested for now, maybe I'll come back later.~
@203  = ~I knew you were a bitch! Now you DIE!~
@204  = ~Keep your gold. I shall join forces with you. No fee at all... that means I do not work for you. Have that always in mind.~
@205  = ~Sorry, I said it is not negotiable. Take it or leave it.~
@206  = ~Very well, here is the money. Join and let's get going. My name is <CHARNAME>, if I've not told already...~
@207  = ~Too much for me. Maybe I come back later.~
@208  = ~A thousand, are you crazy, woman!? Forget about it, farewell, and I hope I never see you again!~
@209  = ~Nice doing business with you, <CHARNAME>. Chloe, of the Yr'Kai tribe. Let's go, then.~
@210  = ~That depends. What goal is it that you pursue?~
@211  = ~(Shrugs) A thousand gold pieces. No coin less. And I'm being rather generous... compared to some of the contracts I've signed up for, that is a mere nothing.~
@212  = ~I am sorry, I don't have that much money. What about five hundred? It is all I can spare...~
@213  = ~I am sorry, I don't have that much money. What about five hundred? It is all I can spare... I must save up to twenty thousand so I can receive the help of a powerful local guild for my quest, and I can't spend the money you ask of me...~
@214  = ~I don't have that money... the little coin I have I need it for much more pressing matters, believe you me. Couldn't you join forces with me for free?~
@215  = ~A thousand! That is too much, I can't spare all that money now... wouldn't you join me out of the kindness of your heart?~
@216  = ~I really need the money right now. How about five hundred?~
@217  = ~I must admit I have an ulterior motive for being here in particular. I felt a pull to this area, and now that I'm here I understand why. This is a pocket plane of the air dimension, which I have somewhat of a relationship with.~ [NOSOUND]
@218  = ~We can discuss the nature of that relationship later, if you want, but for now I would ask that we investigate this. A pocket dimension like this takes considerable power and I would know what it's purpose is. Likely there is some manner of treasure or sensitive information that you would be interested in. Regardless, let us investigate, shall we?~
@219  = ~I notice that you are a warrior, <CHARNAME>. Tell me, what manner of warrior are you?~ [NOSOUND]
@220  = ~I am but a simple warrior, I hit things until they die. Well, usually anyway.~
@221  = ~I am a monk. I dedicate my life to training my body and mind to perfection.~
@222  = ~I am a barbarian! Is it that hard to tell!? You must meet my friend Lothar...~
@223  = ~I am a kensai, and proud of it! No clunky armor for me! Hey... nice swords.~
@224  = ~Huh?~
@225  = ~Warrior you may be, but simple I would dare say not. Perhaps my opinion will change later on. No matter, let us continue on then.~
@226  = ~Ah, not so different than my own life. I can relate to such a pursuit, though I am not a monk. All right then, let us carry on.~
@227  = ~I see. I did not want to make assumptions. And Lothar? I've heard of him. A witless braggart who claims to have seen and done much, but no one has witnessed him doing any of it. Hmph. Very well then, let us go.~
@228  = ~Ah, excellent, it's good to see another kensai about. Let us go then, friend, and show these creatures what the kensai can do!~
@229  = ~Let me rephrase then. What fighting style and lifestyle do you follow? You don't seem the holy or naturey type, so I've ruled out paladin and ranger. What, then?~
@230  = ~My "master" summons me again. What great joy... wait, you are not my captor. Who are you? I see, the master is gone and you have gotten yourselves in trouble. But I sense something in one of you...~
@231  = ~I am not surprised. What is a genie of the plane of air doing in such a place as this?~
@232  = ~The one who has captured me is the same as had captured your comrades. He has me trapped here to guard some of his treasure. I sense that one of these items belongs to your companion here.~
@233  = ~I'm not sure what it is, <CHARNAME>, but you seem different somehow from the average person.~ [CHLOEGP1]
@234  = ~I'm eh... a Bhaalspawn.~
@235  = ~How so, Chloe? Is my tunic on backwards?~
@236  = ~I'm not so different... hey, is that a spotted owl?~
@237  = ~I'd rather not talk about it, ok?~
@238  = ~Ok, if you change your mind I'll listen.~
@239  = ~Ok, but if you want to talk about it later let me know. And no, that's a quail, silly.~
@240  = ~No, silly. There's something else...~
@241  = ~I'm a Bhaalspawn.~
@242  = ~I don't want to talk about it, sorry.~
@243  = ~As you wish.~
@244  = ~Bhaal? The dead god of murder? That Bhaal?~
@245  = ~Yes.~
@246  = ~Yeah, does that impress you?~
@247  = ~Yep. My mom must have been pretty desperate. Unless Bhaal is built like a...~
@248  = ~Can we change the subject? Or better yet, stop talking altogether.~
@249  = ~Ok.~
@250  = ~Ok, ok. Please don't finish that sentence. I think it's time to get back on the road. Ew.~
@251  = ~No. I'm impressed by deeds, not bloodlines. Let's talk about this later.~
@252  = ~Well, that would explain it. How do you feel about that?~
@253  = ~Like I've missed all those father-son moments... playing pin the dagger in the Halfling, razing a town or two to the ground, sacrificing a few virgins, you know, the usual.~ ~Like I've missed all those father-daughter moments... playing pin the dagger in the Halfling, razing a town or two to the ground, sacrificing a few virgins, you know, the usual.~
@254  = ~How would YOU feel about being the child of the god of murder? I feel like everyone is always watching me, like I'm about to turn into some huge ugly monster at any time and start slaughtering everything in sight or something...~
@255  = ~Well I wish I was just a blacksmith's son or something like that, but I've been dealing with it fairly well.~ ~Well I wish I was just a farmer's daughter or something like that, but I've been dealing with it fairly well.~
@256  = ~I know what you mean. My mother is Akadia, goddess of air. So we have that in common I guess.~
@257  = ~Oh... that's um... what are the chances of two divine children running into each other?~
@258  = ~That must be pretty nice.~
@259  = ~Well I guess that's pretty interesting. Anyway, let's get going. I'm starting to get hungry and I want to find a decent campsite before too long.~
@260  = ~As am I. Let's go then.~
@261  = ~Sometimes. It has its advantages and disadvantages like all things. We'll talk about it more later though. Let's get back on the road.~
@262  = ~I would guess pretty slim. But we'll talk about this more later. We have things to do.~
@263  = ~Well, you never know. Divine blood has some strange effects sometimes. I wouldn't worry about it though.~
@264  = ~You sound as if you speak from experience.~
@265  = ~Yeah, I suppose. Let's get going again, I'm eager to get to our destination.~
@266  = ~Well if it's suddenly being able to fly around, shoot fireballs from my hands, and have weapons bounce off me, it won't be so bad. Or at least being able to carry a tune when I sing...~
@267  = ~(Laughs) I'd settle for being able to cook a hare without burning the meat, personally. Let's talk about this more later though. Things to do, and all that.~
@268  = ~Yes. My mother is Akadia, goddess of air.~
@269  = ~Are you um... serious?~
@270  = ~Yes. Why?~
@271  = ~No. Can't you tell a jest when you hear one?~
@272  = ~Not when I just met someone and don't know their humor yet, no. Anyway, I know what it's like to be the child of a god. My mother is Akadia.~
@273  = ~Weren't we just talking about me?~
@274  = ~Ah, well at least she isn't the goddess of murder. The urge to kill gets pretty strong sometimes.~
@275  = ~Well, as long as I don't wake up with you hovering over me with a dagger, I'm ok with it, for now. Anyway, let's continue on with our journey.~
@276  = ~I thought we were having a conversation. Regardless, it's over now.~
@277  = ~Just wondering... I'll leave you alone now.~
@278  = ~Do you know much about my tribe, the Yr'kai?~ [CHLOEGP2]
@279  = ~They founded the kensai style of combat, did they not?~
@280  = ~Not much I'm afraid. Tell me about them, if you'd like.~
@281  = ~You're my what? I don't understand.~
@282  = ~All those barbarian tribes seem alike to me. I'm not really interested in knowing more.~
@283  = ~Alright. I'll just go back to hitting bones with stones to make daggers and knitting animal hide clothing now.~
@284  = ~The Yr'kai, silly. We founded the kensai fighting style.~
@285  = ~Oh. Kensai are kind of... crazy.~
@286  = ~What's a Kensai?~
@287  = ~Ah, no wonder you fight like that. I thought you were poor and couldn't afford armor.~
@288  = ~Ah ok. Well, you learn something new every day. Let's get moving again, shall we?~
@289  = ~Oh, actually I'm a kensai too. I figured you were as well, but I didn't know about the Yr'kai tribe. Tell me about them...~
@290  = ~My, how ignorant. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@291  = ~I'm a kensai. A warrior who fights with a sword unencumbered by armor.~
@292  = ~Are the Yr'kai very warlike?~
@293  = ~Are all Yr'kai women as cute as you are?~
@294  = ~I don't want to talk about the Yr'kai, I want to talk about the kensai.~
@295  = ~Actually I think we're done with this conversation. Let's talk about something else next time.~
@296  = ~I suppose it seems sort of strange for a warrior to fight without armor, but we were talking about the Yr'kai, not the Kensai.~
@297  = ~What are the Yr'kai like outside of the battlefield?~
@298  = ~Alright. Perhaps we can talk about your snoring next time.~
@299  = ~We'll talk about the kensai another day. Now do you want to hear about the Yr'kai, or not?~
@300  = ~Yes, tell me about them...~
@301  = ~No thanks. I'm not interested.~
@302  = ~Ok, your choice.~
@303  = ~Not all, no. There are some rather attractive ladies in my village though. Thank you for the compliment, by the way.~
@304  = ~Yes, though not as much as we use to be. We nearly became extinct about a century ago because of overaggressive behavior. But there is more to the Yr'kai than warfare.~
@305  = ~Yes. There is more to the Yr'kai than just kensai fighting, though.~
@306  = ~Kensai are nothing more than crazed barbarians, if you ask me. It wouldn't surprise me if your people invented the art.~
@307  = ~Most of our culture is based on two things: Perfecting ourselves by training the body and the mind daily; and the worship of Akadia and Lathandar.~
@308  = ~We begin training as children as soon as we can stand and hold a sword. We practice every day, without fail, no matter what. Any day without improvement is a day wasted, as my torque... teacher, used to tell us.~
@309  = ~As far as Akadia and Lathandar, it is the common belief that they created the Yr'kai people together, though we do not know why. It is said that they wanted the perfect warriors and told us to constantly seek perfection and we would be rewarded in the afterlife.~
@310  = ~We have been perfecting ourselves a little more each day, each year, each generation, since then. Every generation we seem to be better warriors than our parents, so we are getting closer to perfection, perhaps, if perfection is even a goal that is achievable in life. Sorry for the long explanation.~
@311  = ~It was fascinating. Thank you.~
@312  = ~Try not to take this the wrong way, but next time you can use shorter explanations. You lost me a minute or two ago.~
@313  = ~Perfecting yourselves for war... how... how sad.~
@314  = ~Never mind.~
@315  = ~Sorry. I'll work on that.~
@316  = ~You've lost a number of companions recently, and probably even more in the past. I am sorry you've lost so many friends.~ [CHLOEGP3]
@317  = ~It's one of the hardships of being an adventurer... though one I will never get used to. It is always sad to lose those we are close to.~
@318  = ~I get over it rather quickly. We can't let these things bog us down, or we'd be mired in our own self-pity and fall victim to the same fate, ourselves.~
@319  = ~I wasn't especially close to any of them. I try not to get attached, given my current lifestyle.~
@320  = ~Can we not talk about this? It's hard enough coping with the fallen. It is only made more difficult when it is spoken of like this. I'm sorry.~
@321  = ~Of course. Forgive my intrusion.~
@322  = ~What a sad way to live. I pity you. I'll stop talking now. I wouldn't want you to get attached or anything.~
@323  = ~I suppose. There is no shame in mourning the dead, though. I've shed my share of tears over comrades and relatives alike.~
@324  = ~Understandable. Do the Yr'kai have any special funeral proceedings? Do you bury your dead or what?~
@325  = ~I've wept over a few. I wanted to cry when Imoen was abducted by those damnable wizards, but I still hold out hope that she is alright.~
@326  = ~I'll never shed a tear over the fallen. They're gone. There is no point to it. Life is for the living, after all.~
@327  = ~Aw... how precious.~
@328  = ~You can be as ugly as a troll's backside, has anyone ever told you that? Now shut your mouth before more sewage spills forth.~
@329  = ~Everyone is entitled to their opinions. I choose to honor and remember the dead. If you choose to live in ignorance and forget your fallen comrades, that is your right. And it is my right to end this conversation now.~
@330  = ~I'm sure we'll get to her before anything too bad happens. More than likely she is just bored out of her mind sitting around in a cell that she doesn't belong in. Let's continue on. The sooner we rescue her the better, after all.~
@331  = ~We actually don't bury our dead. We burn them on a pyre to honor Lathandar and then the wind carries our ashes away. A special powder is mixed up and added to the flames to turn them blue and the flame becomes hot enough to leave nothing of the body. The sword and all the warrior's personal possessions that weren't to be given to others as gifts are burned with the fallen.~
@332  = ~Why?~
@333  = ~Wow... and to think most people just toss their dead into a hole in the ground and possibly cover it with a few stones. Is there any marker left where the dead is to remember them by?~
@334  = ~You don't keep everything? Not like the dead person needs it. How strange. I'm more than likely going to be buried naked and some beggar will be wearing my boots.~
@335  = ~That's always a possibility, I suppose. Not everyone's funeral is handled the way they wish for it to be, after all. Let us press on before we find ourselves in need of funerals.~
@336  = ~Every Yr'kai warrior who falls in battle is entered into the silver record. There is usually a mistress and apprentice records keeper. The mistress has the entire list memorized, as well as the deeds of the fallen. The apprentice learns them throughout her life. It is also kept in quilts, parchments, or some similar item that can be carried easily. It has been destroyed several times in wars, so that is why the mistresses always memorize it.~
@337  = ~We've taken a long enough break. Let us press onward, shall we?~
@338  = ~Tradition. Some believe we reach the afterworld with the possessions we are burned with. Others feel it's just a matter of respecting what the fallen has gained in their lives. Speaking of gains, let us continue our journey so we may continue ours.~
@339  = ~I agree. The Yr'kai believe that when our warriors die in honorable battle, they are lifted up to spend an eternity as Akadia's personal guards. Akadia's realm is said to be a paradise, yet even in death the fallen Yr'kai continue to practice daily, constantly improving their skills to better serve our goddess.~
@340  = ~Don't you want to live to a ripe old age before that happens, though?~
@341  = ~What happens if you die of old age or illness?~
@342  = ~So *that's* why you're all a bunch of murderous bastards.~
@343  = ~It doesn't sound incredibly pleasant, but to each their own. Let's continue on, shall we?~
@344  = ~Alright.~
@345  = ~If you ever say anything like that to me again, then rest assured you'll find out just how murderous of a bastard I can be. Kindly shut your damned mouth now.~
@346  = ~Some believe that we suffer in the hells, others that we instead serve as handmaidens and menservants in Lathandar's palace. I personally believe we are reborn to be given another chance. But ultimately, none of us know for sure.~
@347  = ~I'm betting on hell. It makes sense, if dying honorably in combat is rewarded, that dying in shame from illness is punished.~
@348  = ~Serving as a handmaiden for Lathandar wouldn't be too bad. An alternative to warfare in Akadia's realm, and probably a rather pleasant one at that.~
@349  = ~Being reborn sounds like the best option, if it's true. If you mess up, I like the idea that you can try again.~
@350  = ~Perhaps it matters more how well a life you lead, rather than how you die.~
@351  = ~The Drow have similar beliefs. If we fail Lloth, we suffer in the afterlife. If we please her, we become her handservants. I am quite a bit more content with Shar's blessings.~
@352  = ~It is possible. Living honorably mattering more than dying honorably? It's a pleasant notion, one I don't dismiss altogether. Still, it's all pointless to guess. We'll all find out one day.~
@353  = ~I agree completely. I find myself wondering how much of your prior life you resemble, if being reborn is what truly happens. I suppose it matters little, though. You'd be a completely different person. Perhaps one that doesn't get cramped feet in the morning. (Giggles) Let's press on though, shall we?~
@354  = ~Yes, it could be rather nice and peaceful. I imagine it'd get a bit boring after a while though. But boring isn't always bad. Let us continue on, then <CHARNAME>.~
@355  = ~Perhaps. Though I can't be sure, I don't feel my mother is that cruel. But, as I said before, no one knows for sure. We can't know until we're there and then we can't exactly tell anyone about it. We're lagging behind the others though, let's catch up.~
@356  = ~Of course. And then, old and withered, I shall enter my last battle and die an honorable and glorious death. Perhaps defending a peaceful village, or someone I love.~
@357  = ~It sounds nice, though I try not to think about my own death too often. Do the Yr'kai have any special burial practices?~
@358  = ~That's very noble, if a little foolish. It doesn't really matter how one dies, it matters how they live. I think that's what you should focus on, Chloe. We can't know how we'll be treated in death, so why waste time worrying about it?~
@359  = ~How depressing. I'm getting a bit misty-eyed thinking about all this death, can we not talk about this? I'm sorry.~
@360  = ~We'll all more than likely be dead within a few winters, but I guess there's no harm in dreaming. I think that's enough of a rest. Let's carry on.~
@361  = ~I'm actually hoping that I find some means to gain immortality or godhood. I don't want to have to worry about all this death stuff.~
@362  = ~(Laughs) I suppose we all need goals, <CHARNAME>. Let's get on with our current ones.~
@363  = ~If you say so.~
@364  = ~Of course. I understand. I apologize for bringing it up.~
@365  = ~I suppose. Death is a part of life, though, so I do not feel it is foolish to think about it. I shall keep quiet about it in the future, though.~
@366  = ~So what was it like growing up in Candlekeep, <CHARNAME>?~ [CHLOEGP4]
@367  = ~A lot of reading. More reading. Long talks with Gorion on various subjects. And occasionally I managed to get into trouble with Imoen. How about growing up in your Yr'kai village?~
@368  = ~Most of the time Imoen was getting into trouble and I was bailing her out. Hmm... our current situation is pretty familiar. What was it like growing up in your village?~
@369  = ~Actually... I don't remember much of it. Irenicus and his damnable tortures stole many precious memories from me. My past has grown blurry.~
@370  = ~I don't want to talk about my childhood.~
@371  = ~I must admit most of my days were basically the same so they blurred together. Still, despite all my training, I had time to play and get into trouble, so I had a happy childhood. Would you consider yours happy, <CHARNAME>?~
@372  = ~Yes, despite all my lessons and the few other children around, I had a happy childhood.~
@373  = ~It was all right I guess.~
@374  = ~It was dreadful. Gorion had this bad habit of walking around during lessons and scratching his posterior. It was hideous!~
@375  = ~I hated it. It was horrible. My guardian Gorion was a complete ogre!~
@376  = ~Well, I suppose you turned out decently enough, regardless of how bad a guardian Gorion was.~
@377  = ~(Laughs) Please, spare me the unpleasant visuals. Let's get back to our adventures.~
@378  = ~Oh. Ok.~
@379  = ~I suppose that's all that matters in the end. Let's get going, shall we?~
@380  = ~The most obvious events of my past are the daily practices. Sword fighting, mental discipline, reading, philosophical debates, discussions on honor. We were also allowed to play, or get into trouble a bit. Punishments for getting into trouble got progressively worse as we aged, to teach us discipline but to allow us to have fun and freedom at an early age, which we feel is important.~
@381  = ~Sounds nice. Did you like it, or secretly hate it as a child?~
@382  = ~That must have been rather grueling. Maybe boring as well.~
@383  = ~And I thought *my* training was bad... (laugh) Despite all the training, did you have a happy childhood?~
@384  = ~That is just totally uninteresting to me. Sorry. Perhaps we'll run into something more interesting as we continue on.~
@385  = ~Bah, I would hardly call you an honorable person, my lady.~
@386  = ~One does not have to be a knight of the Order to be honorable, Anomen. Yr'kai follow their own code of honor. It is different from yours, but not especially so.~
@387  = ~I grew to enjoy it and I found my fun when I was able. I was treated well. So yes, I had a happy childhood. I have many pleasant memories, more so than the unpleasant ones. Many cannot say the same, I am afraid. But enough of this topic, we've fun of our own to have this day. Carry on, <CHARNAME>, and lead us to adventure.~
@388  = ~I admit I rather disliked it when I was a child. I grew to enjoy it eventually though. A part of that came from competing with the other children. Other reasons would be accepting who I was and why I was going through the training I did. Accepting that playing all the time was counterproductive to my future survival. And it made me appreciate the times that I was able to play.~
@389  = ~I see your point. My fondest memories were of playing with Imoen or helping her play a prank on one of the old monks. But I suppose I learned my lessons well regardless of actually remembering the sessions. Well, it's time to press on now.~
@390  = ~I disliked my lessons as a child as well. But I appreciate them now as an adult. Whether or not I've matured is a matter of opinion of course. (chuckle) We've rested long enough though, time to get on with our adventures.~
@391  = ~I would have disliked it still as an adult, I must admit. I still dislike my lessons in Candlekeep, regardless of whether they were necessary or not.~
@392  = ~You disliked it because it was dreadful and you only learned to appreciate it because you had to in order to preserve your sanity.~
@393  = ~How... pleasant of you to say so, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps Gorion enjoyed slapping you around a bit as a child and you learned to appreciate it to preserve *your* sanity. Believe what you like, regardless.~
@394  = ~Someday you'll probably learn to appreciate them though, <CHARNAME>. They've served you well thus far.~
@395  = ~All right.~
@396  = ~So this Gorion I've been hearing about... he was like a father to you or more like a teacher?~ [CHLOEGP5]
@397  = ~He was as much a father to me as any man could have been, biological relation or no.~
@398  = ~I guess you could call him my father. I wasn't very close to him though. We never really bonded, I'm sorry to say.~
@399  = ~He took me in but he wasn't what I would call a father. We were no closer than student and pupil.~
@400  = ~Actually Imoen was more a father to me... no really! A short, feminine, childlike father with breasts. Oh and one who likes to get me into all sorts of trouble... and blame me for it when Winthrop or Gorion caught us... in fact, when we rescue her, perhaps I'll call her daddy and see how she reacts!~
@401  = ~Oh please... I've talked about Gorion so much since he died that I keep expecting him to show up as a specter and tell me to stop talking about him and bugging him!~
@402  = ~Sorry to bring it up. I'll leave you alone now.~
@403  = ~(Laughs) You're silly. I don't think Imoen would appreciate being called a father figure though, feminine or otherwise.~
@404  = ~So how about you? I know your mother is Akadia but who was your father?~
@405  = ~You haven't seen Imoen when she was impersonating Winthrop... now *that* is scary!~
@406  = ~Well I could throw in cute and she'd be perfectly fine with it. Amazing how that works. By the way, you're pretty cute when you laugh, Chloe.~
@407  = ~It's rather ineffective to tell someone that you tell girls they're cute to make them forget everything else you said and then tell said person that they are cute. Nice try, though.~
@408  = ~(laughs) Well, that is something I will have to see. Let's get back to our adventures so we rescue Imoen as soon as possible then.~
@409  = ~The only thing I know about him was his name was Masemeron. Supposedly he was or is a great warrior, but strangely enough no one seems to have heard of him outside of my tribe. ~
@410  = ~Ye've got that right. I've ne'er heard of the lanky git that done fathered ye, either.~
@411  = ~I'm not quite sure what to think about that. But it matters little, I suppose. He wasn't there while I was growing up, and I'm old enough now to not need a father anymore anyway. Had he been one of my tribe I wouldn't have known which man was my father regardless. Let's get going, this trip down memory lane is making my head hurt.~
@412  = ~That's too bad. I sometimes wonder what it would be like to have someone that I could think of as a father.~
@413  = ~Do you know anything about your father?~
@414  = ~You grew and prospered even without a father. You should feel pride in that, at least.~
@415  = ~It's nothing special. A fuss over obscene language here. A "don't cut my robes up to make into a roof for your play fort" there. You're better off without it.~
@416  = ~I guess that would make you a bastard then, wouldn't it?~
@417  = ~I hardly think that you are justified to call me that, Bhaalspawn. I think it best you stop talking now.~
@418  = ~Heh sounds like you had quite an adventurous childhood. Speaking of adventure, I suppose we should get back to ours.~
@419  = ~Thank you. It's little comfort, but it has to do.~
@420  = ~I envy you. The only thing I know about him was his name was Masemeron. Supposedly he was or is a great warrior, but strangely enough no one seems to have heard of him outside of my tribe. ~
@421  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, now that we've stopped for a rest I wish to ask you of your youth. Did you have any sort of passage into adulthood? Some ritual or event, perhaps, that recognized you as an adult?~ [CHLOEGP6]
@422  = ~No ritual, per se. Some regard the first time that one shares oneself with another as a passage into adulthood, others after a certain age, and still others regard marriage as the mark of an adult. But I suppose I regarded myself as an adult after I took to the road after Gorion's death. How about yourself?~
@423  = ~There was some small bit of ritual when I came of age. Mainly I just had the monks of Candlekeep telling me I was an adult in several languages, I drank some wine, and I didn't have to sit at the children's table anymore...~
@424  = ~Oh yes. It was an elaborate ritual, involving the sacrifice of a sheep, being anointed in oils, swearing my allegiance to some secret order of some sort, I wonder which one? There were also some courtesans from Calimshan, oh and the dancing naked in the moonlight. It started raining though, I got very cold. And I was rather embarrassed when I noticed I was the only one without clothing. And Imoen was running off with my britches and laughing at me...~
@425  = ~No, nothing special. I'm not really in the mood to talk right now though. I just want to drink a little water, wipe the sweat off my brow, and get back to our journeys, ok? Sorry.~
@426  = ~I understand. Pardon me for disturbing you.~
@427  = ~Oh, gee is that all? Mine involved ritual combat against the greatest torque in Yir'lanieara... those are the plains that my, and several other Yr'kai villages, make their home.~
@428  = ~Ritual combat, like a joust perhaps? I have taken part in such events as well.~
@429  = ~In Rasheman, one is not an adult until the Dajemma is completed. Oh, woe is Minsc, he will never be a man!~
@430  = ~My coming of age involved ritual combat against the greatest torque in Yir'lanieara... those are the plains that my, and several other Yr'kai villages, make their home.~
@431  = ~He defeated me, but he had to take off his restrictive clothing to do it.~
@432  = ~What do you mean? What does the combat involve?~
@433  = ~He took off his clothing?! Why?~
@434  = ~So he got naked to distract you? I see. It must have been horrible.~
@435  = ~That's nice. Let's get moving again, though.~
@436  = ~Oh no, I didn't mean he took off *all* of his clothing. See, the greatest master in the area puts on very tight clothing to restrict his or her movement. It slowed him down enough to make it a little more fair. The young one seeking adulthood almost always loses, but the skill, patience, and improvisation that the young one shows marks whether he or she is ready to become an adult in the tribe. The whole village judges the worth of the young one, and he or she cannot marry or leave the village until adulthood.~
@437  = ~So you were beating him while he had all the extra clothes on, I take it?~
@438  = ~What a strange ritual.~
@439  = ~Well I guess you have to get your jollies somehow. Let's get going again.~
@440  = ~Strange, perhaps, but effective. No one leaves the safety of our village until they are ready. Speaking of being ready, I am ready to continue our trek.~
@441  = ~Yes, our fight lasted a long time. An hour or two and he asked if he could take the restrictive clothing off. It was a great honor, so I agreed. He beat me within 5 minutes of that. Hah... but it was the best fight of my life. Anyway, that's how I became an adult in my tribe. Let's get going again when you're done drinking your water.~
@442  = ~The master puts on very tight restrictive clothing so he moves slower and can't fight as well. It evens it out a bit since the young one isn't near as skilled. But after an hour of combat we were no closer to having an end of the combat so he asked if he could remove the restricting clothing. It was a great honor so I agreed. I was defeated within a few minutes after that. But it was the greatest fight of my life, regardless.~
@443  = ~And that is how I became an adult. Let's get moving again, we've talked long enough.~
@444  = ~The greatest master in the area puts on very tight clothing to restrict his or her movement. It slowed him down enough to make it a little more fair. The young one seeking adulthood almost always loses, but the skill, patience, and improvisation that he or she shows marks whether or not they are ready to become an adult in the tribe. The whole village judges the worth of the young one, and he or she cannot marry or leave the village until adulthood.~
@445  = ~So what is your take on all this good and evil stuff, <CHARNAME>? What do you think they are?~ [CHLOEGP7]
@446  = ~Good is trying to always do the thing that benefits the most people, I suppose. Evil is doing that which is harmful to many.~
@447  = ~Good is that which follows the law, evil is all that is against the law.~
@448  = ~Good is helping those that cannot help themselves, even if there is no reward. Evil is turning one's back on the helpless or only helping for all their coin.~
@449  = ~Good and evil don't exist. They're tools to help us sleep at night. We consider ourselves good and those we oppose as evil so we do not feel as bad spilling their blood.~
@450  = ~Good is when I get what I want. Evil is when things are taken away from me or when I am prevented from getting what I want.~
@451  = ~Ale is good, water is evil. What a silly question.~
@452  = ~I have no desire to talk about this sort of thing. Who cares?~
@453  = ~I do, but I'll not press the issue.~
@454  = ~A <PRO_MANWOMAN> who knows what <PRO_HESHE> is talkin about at last! Har har!~
@455  = ~Yes, I suppose it is at that. Enjoy your ale.~
@456  = ~Hmm...~
@457  = ~Har har! <CHARNAME> is exactly right!~
@458  = ~Very true... (but it's obvious to all but these idiotic simians that it is I, Edwin Odesseiron, who must get what he wants!)~
@459  = ~That's... that's a horrible thing to say, <CHARNAME>! I never realized you were so heartless.~
@460  = ~But what of moral dilemmas? Given the choice between, say, godhood and the lives of everyone you love and care for, which would you choose? Basically, ultimate power or the lives of your closest friends?~
@461  = ~Godhood. I would hate to have my friends die, but think of how much good I could do as a god? The lives of a few friends are a small price to pay, I believe.~
@462  = ~Godhood. Perhaps I could resurrect my friends once I attained divinity. I just hope they would forgive me for letting them be dead for a few minutes.~
@463  = ~It would hurt to give up divinity, but I cannot abandon my friends to death. I would give it up. What is worth more than my friends, after all?~
@464  = ~I don't know. I can't make that decision.~
@465  = ~I have no intention of becoming a God, I've never wanted to have power over others and I certainly would never risk my friends well-being to get it.~
@466  = ~If you do not desire divinity, I wonder what you do want? Your selfish response before seems strange compared with what you say now. You are either indecisive or you want something other than power. Either way, I'm not sure I care for the answer. But, it's nice that you would not let your companions fall so you could be elevated.~
@467  = ~Fair enough. But most likely your friends would all die and you would lose your chance at divinity because of your indecision, and thus you lose everything. Or maybe nothing would happen and everything would be fine. Let's hope that decision never comes about.~
@468  = ~A selfless decision. But perhaps you could have resurrected your friends after gaining divinity? Did you consider that? Regardless, it's nice to know that you place your friends before your personal attainment of power.~
@469  = ~Quite a risk to take. I'm not sure I care for your choice, but it is yours to make after all.~
@470  = ~Well, it's good to know that you care so much for us all, <CHARNAME>. I hope you wouldn't have to sleep as a god, because I wonder how well you *could* sleep seeing everyone you love die as you gain immortality.~
@471  = ~I would tend to agree with that.~
@472  = ~Good and evil do exist, but they must be kept in balance!~
@473  = ~All things wither away into nothingness anyway. Good and evil mean nothing. Just enjoy your life while you have it, my sparrows!~
@474  = ~However, that tells me nothing of how you would react to things. A hypothetical situation, then:~
@475  = ~Someone you love, perhaps your lover or Imoen, has been accused of slaughtering a high ranking noble and is to be executed for the crime. Your loved one claims they did such an act because the person was a monster, a shape-shifter posing as the noble, who was already dead. You have no idea whether they are telling the truth, but they will be executed within a few nights unless you raid the jail and free them. If you do so, however, you and they will be hunted for the rest of your lives. What do you do?~
@476  = ~I break them out, of course! I will not abandon one I love to such a fate, even if it means we must flee and live as vagabonds.~
@477  = ~I would break them out then try to prove their innocence, or die trying.~
@478  = ~I would say goodbye to them with a heavy heart and allow justice to be carried out. There is nothing I can do for my loved one then, other than give them a difficult and likely short life on the run. They would not want my life ruined as well, I trust.~
@479  = ~I would leave. Love doesn't exist, either. It's just a trapping of the weak.~
@480  = ~That is the most disgusting load of sewage to ever pass from someone's lips into my ear. You do not deserve to rescue Imoen, but I will not abandon her even if you do. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>, perhaps we'll meet again. I hope for your sake that you grow a heart in that time.~
@481  = ~So you would abandon one you love because it would make your life more difficult to rescue them? You disgust me. Our conversation is over.~
@482  = ~Shape-shifters stay in the form they were in when they die, thus making it impossible to prove that one was such a thing in death. You must force them to shift while alive. Fire, I hear, is their greatest fear. But, the noble would be dead already and you could not prove anything. Most likely you and your loved one die soon after. A pity.~
@483  = ~A noble decision. It is possible, of course, that the real shape-shifter was posing as your loved one and slaughters you in your sleep and takes a new form. But, you never know with such things.~
@484  = ~Exactly! That... that is so true. There is nothing more noble than helping the helpless.~
@485  = ~How naive. The helpless are weak and deserve any fate they receive. There is no point in helping them without a reward.~
@486  = ~This from the lady who was helpless and about to be burnt at the stake before being rescued.~
@487  = ~That... was different. Helping friends, whether they are helpless or not, is always advantageous.~
@488  = ~Ok, you come across a man who is being attacked by three others. The first man is weaponless, injured, and on the ground. The others are retired soldiers and have weapons. The man on the ground is pleading for your help saying the men are brigands, but the ex-soldiers tell you that he is a shape-shifter who has killed their families and eaten them. What do you do? You cannot know for certain who is telling the truth until one or the other are corpses, after all.~
@489  = ~I attack the brigands. I don't believe that the man is a shape-shifter.~
@490  = ~I help slay the shape-shifter. I've seen that ploy before, after all.~
@491  = ~I leave them alone. I don't know which of them is telling the truth so I don't get involved.~
@492  = ~I would just slaughter them all. As far as I know they are brigands attacking a shape-shifter who slaughtered their families and either one would turn on me as I slay the other.~
@493  = ~I believe the truth could be gotten at by talking, in my experience Doppelgangers get frustrated quickly, and are likely to resume their normal form when caught in a lie. Questions about what the brigands want for example.~
@494  = ~I doubt very much that the armed men would sit back patiently while you question a man who slaughtered and devoured their loved ones. And even if they did, what if you encountered a crafty and patient shifter? It is good you don't always rush to action, but it is naive to assume that you will be allowed to do so by others.~
@495  = ~How... vicious of you. Perhaps your Bhaal blood plays more part in your decisions than you realize.~
@496  = ~And after seeing the defenseless man slaughtered, perhaps you would always wonder if the man was innocent and his fearful and pleading eyes would haunt your dreams for a long time to come. Hmm. There are always consequences for our actions, after all. Even in inaction.~
@497  = ~As you're striking the man down, a brigand stabs you in the back and loots you of all your valuables. Let's get back on the road and hope we don't run into any shape-shifters or brigands of dubious nature.~
@498  = ~As you stand over the last dead soldier you feel the claws of the shape-shifter tear into your back. The shape-shifter eats well for several weeks to come.~
@499  = ~I could not have stated it more clearly myself, <CHARNAME>. The forces of chaos must always be vanquished to preserve the good in this world.~
@500  = ~All good things stem from the law. It is there to keep order in life and with order comes goodness.~
@501  = ~Ok. A peasant woman steals a loaf of bread from your pack to feed to her starving children because her lord has overtaxed her family and the crops were bad that year. You catch the woman as she is stealing the bread, however. Do you turn her in, following the law and your goodness, or do you let her go and ignore the law and act in an evil manner, according to your definition?~
@502  = ~I would turn her in to the authorities. I must obey the law, no matter the circumstances. The law is not flexible, we must adhere to it or society crumbles.~
@503  = ~I would turn her in to the authorities, but I would also give her family enough money so that they could care for themselves. That way, the law is preserved but her family does not suffer for her criminal behavior.~
@504  = ~I would let her go with the bread. Sometimes the law must be bent for the greater good.~
@505  = ~I would let her go but then I would deal with the real problem, her lord. A man like that who would let his subjects starve deserves to die.~
@506  = ~I'd let her take the bread, she obviously needs it more than me. I'd then go to the Lord and investigate her claims, seeking to convince him to ease taxes if the claims proved true.~
@507  = ~So you'd support lawless behavior under special circumstances? I guess that means you're evil, by your definition. Regardless, do you think the lord would tell the truth if he really was overtaxing the peasants? And if you could find out it *was* true, and he refused to lower taxes, would you slay him, thus delving even further into lawless evil? Interesting choice, though I worry about your apparent inability to abide by your own definition of good behavior.~
@508  = ~And then perhaps later you would find out that this woman was the only subject that was starving and it was because she and her family were too lazy to work their land properly, and you just killed a lord that was just trying to motivate her into working the land to provide for her family. But, at least you tried to do the right thing, I suppose.~
@509  = ~So by your definition both you and she would act in an evil and destructive manner? How sad.~
@510  = ~So you would rob her family of her for trying to take a loaf of bread from you then you would bribe her family to make yourself feel better about it? Interesting.~
@511  = ~And you would be content in the knowledge that you preserved society as you saw the woman imprisoned for the rest of her life or executed for theft. Congratulations on that, <CHARNAME>.~
@512  = ~I would agree with that, <CHARNAME>.~
@513  = ~Yes, like how a cruel noble inflicts pain and suffering on the many peasants working his land to get them to work harder. That is definitely evil.~
@514  = ~What if a small frightened child was standing in front of you and the people of his village were convinced that the child carried the plague and had to be killed but you were sure that he was healthy or that it wasn't past the point of a priest's help? Would it be good to slay the child to protect the people who did not want to catch the plague?~
@515  = ~Yes. Sometimes the few must die to protect the many. It's sad when it happens, but it is the right thing to do.~
@516  = ~Well... I would try to cure the child and then convince the people that he was healthy once more and that his death was unnecessary.~
@517  = ~No... I would protect the child as best I could, knowing I was in the right. It would be the good thing to do.~
@518  = ~No, but I would not get involved. The villagers have a right to feel safe from disease, after all. Whether they are right or wrong means little in the end. The child is probably carrying the plague if they say he is, though.~
@519  = ~I would take the child from the village, thus protecting the people, and seek to find the child a cure, perhaps in a large city which would have better medicines and more powerful healers.~
@520  = ~Likely if the child was carrying the plague you both would die before reaching the city. Even if you didn't, you'd risk infecting the entire city before you got to a temple. Many of those people would probably be too poor to pay for a cure. Interesting choice, though.~
@521  = ~Ah and immediately you justify your actions and theirs to keep from feeling guilty about letting an innocent child get slaughtered. Funny how that works. Sometimes you can't justify it to yourself though and you have nightmares about the event for the rest of your life, <CHARNAME>. Let's get going though. I've teased your morals enough for today.~
@522  = ~So you would slaughter all the villagers that attacked you trying to get to the child in their attempt to protect themselves? How is that good for the many when all it spares is the child? I think perhaps you should rethink your standing on good and evil, my friend.~
@523  = ~But peasants, especially in small villages, are notorious for being paranoid beyond logic. They'd kill you and the child both and burn your corpses. But, it would be a noble effort I suppose.~
@524  = ~Perhaps. Then that child's fearful eyes may haunt your dreams for the rest of your life as you relive slaughtering the child to protect paranoid peasants each night. But that is a choice we must all make, after all.~
@525  = ~You're quite a skilled warrior. You should consider practicing with me sometimes though. I could show you a few new moves and improve your speed, at the very least.~ [CHLOEGP8]
@526  = ~That would be great! I'll spar with you anytime you like. Maybe I can teach you a thing or two as well? (grin)~
@527  = ~I'm not very interesting in sparring. I get more than enough combat from bandits and monsters. Thanks for the offer though.~
@528  = ~I know you think you're this super powerful warrior, Chloe, but can you please not insult my own skills by suggesting I need practice?~
@529  = ~I haven't the time or the desire to spar with you. Now leave me alone, I have more important things to think about.~
@530  = ~Please, girl. I'd slaughter you if we sparred.~
@531  = ~Oh? That's a challenge to my skills, you motherless ogre! One I will not tolerate! We'll see how you do against me, then.~
@532  = ~As you wish. By the way, you drop your guard on the left side so often I'm surprised you haven't been impaled by now.~
@533  = ~Everyone can stand to improve themselves from practice. That's why I practice every single day, despite being a "super powerful warrior". It was just an offer. There was no insult and no cause for an insult in return.~
@534  = ~As you wish. The offer will still stand if you change your mind though. So why did you become a warrior, anyway?~
@535  = ~I found an affinity to the arts of war at an early age. It seemed the best way to focus my anger as well, by learning the mental discipline to stay level-headed in combat.~
@536  = ~I really like hitting things. Getting hurt isn't so great, but bashing and slicing is great fun!~
@537  = ~It's a funny story... I was walking along one day and I found this sword embedded in a stone... I figured, hey, free sword! So I yanked the sucker out. I figured as long as I had it I might as well practice with it. Strange thing was these people started chasing me saying something about some king or other. I got scared thinking I had stolen some king's sword so I ran off, though.~
@538  = ~I was bored. There was someone in Candlekeep looking for an apprentice. He had been a warrior of some skill. I was one of the only children there besides Imoen, and she sure wasn't interested. So, I said what the hells, might as well! I think I look pretty good now, with all this muscle. What do you think?~
@539  = ~I just did, that's all.~
@540  = ~It wouldn't surprise me. I learn something new from every skilled opponent I face. Even some of the ones that barely know which end of a sword to hold. So tell me, what made you decide to pursue the path of the warrior?~
@541  = ~Oh... whatever.~
@542  = ~Muscle means little to a skilled sword master. I'm not a big fan of all the bulk. But if you like it, who am I to complain?~
@543  = ~I get the feeling that you are making that up. (laugh) It is a funny story though. Seems a bit familiar too, but I can't place it. Anyway, next time I practice, feel free to join in.~
@544  = ~Well, I'm glad you are enthusiastic about what you do. Still, don't get to liking the killing too much. I'd hate to have to put you down because the Bhaal blood has taken over.~
@545  = ~Interesting. Well, next time we make camp, if you want to spar, feel free to join me.~
@546  = ~The life of a rogue must be pretty exciting, at times. Picking pockets, dazzling people with charm, all that.~ [NOSOUND]
@547  = ~Yes, it is rather fun, I must admit.~
@548  = ~I guess. It's not really exciting to me, it's just something I'm good at, is all.~
@549  = ~Well, if you think it's so exciting you can give it a try. It's just a job to me.~
@550  = ~I'm just in it for the sex. It turns people on to be with a dangerous <PRO_MANWOMAN>, after all. (grin)~
@551  = ~Yes, yes. Exciting. Woo hoo. Can we not talk about this rubbish?~
@552  = ~You needn't be so damned rude about it. I was just making conversation.~
@553  = ~Right... good luck with that. Let me know when you wake up from your fantasy.~
@554  = ~I'll stick to what I do, thank you very much. Why do it if it doesn't interest you?~
@555  = ~I'm not good at anything else, of course.~
@556  = ~It excited me when I first started, but after you do it a while it gets boring and routine.~
@557  = ~I'm damn good at it, and I look great in leather.~
@558  = ~Why do you do it then if you don't like it?~
@559  = ~(Laugh) Well, whatever works for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@560  = ~Ah. Well, perhaps you'll find renewed interest in it soon.~
@561  = ~How did you get into the rogue business?~
@562  = ~Imoen and I used to pick each other's pockets for practice and fun. Then we started competing to see who could pick the most pockets without getting caught. We made a general nuisance out of ourselves in Candlekeep. (grin)~
@563  = ~Imoen learned things from Winthrop, and then of course she felt obligated to teach them to me. But it was fun. (smile)~
@564  = ~I had a mad compulsion to pick everyone's pockets. I couldn't help myself. By the way, I stole your sharpening stone earlier. Here, I don't need it.~
@565  = ~Well, I'd sing for people and they'd tip a bit but they were often pretty stingy. So I picked their pockets to make up for it. I also learned a few spells from Gorion that came in handy.~
@566  = ~I like stealing, ok? Leave me alone.~
@567  = ~Fine, orc-breath.~
@568  = ~Ah, I see. Well, I guess that's one way to get what you feel you deserve.~
@569  = ~Blasted thief! Pick other people's pockets as much as you like, but keep your fingers out of mine!~
@570  = ~That's good. I'd teach you how to handle your weapon better if I weren't afraid you'd pick my pocket while I taught you. (chuckle)~
@571  = ~Heh. I'm glad you had fun with it, and bonded with Imoen. That's important, I feel.~
@572  = ~I see a lot of similarities between myself and you, <CHARNAME>. We both worship gods and we both use a specific weapon as preferred by our deity.~ [NOSOUND]
@573  = ~Yes, I can see those similarities. Though, I can heal people and you can only carve them up like roasted pheasant.~
@574  = ~Yes, there are some similar traits we share, even beyond that. I'm glad you help protect us though, and I'm happy to be able to heal your wounds when we battle.~
@575  = ~I don't really see those things in common between us, Chloe, but I'll not argue the point. It matters little.~
@576  = ~I have nothing in common with you, Chloe. Please refrain from suggesting such again.~
@577  = ~Well someone is feeling grumpy today. Fine, I'll leave you be.~
@578  = ~I suppose not.~
@579  = ~And I'm very happy to receive your healing. So, what made you decide to become a priest?~
@580  = ~I've always had strong faith in my god. It seemed the logical step, I suppose.~
@581  = ~I figured that my faith in my god and the strengths I gain through my worship would better help me control my Bhaal essence. So I suppose it was a matter of survival.~
@582  = ~I enjoy a good smiting of my foes, especially when the smiting comes from the power of my god. There's nothing more exciting than seeing a goblin explode from a bolt of glory!~
@583  = ~I get a kick out of healing people.~
@584  = ~I just did, ok? Leave it be.~
@585  = ~Sensitive topic? As you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@586  = ~(laugh) Ok, <CHARNAME>.~
@587  = ~Well, everyone has to have a hobby, I suppose. Though you worry me a bit with yours, <CHARNAME>.~
@588  = ~Ah, I see. If that is what helps you to control yourself, then I'm happy for you. It saddens me that you feel obligated to priesthood just to control your homicidal impulses though. Surely you could have learned mental discipline in other pursuits, as well. Ah well, it matters little.~
@589  = ~I see. A natural talent towards such? Understandable. Alright then.~
@590  = ~Right... well I guess I'll go back to grunting and swinging my sword around. Not like there's anything else I can do.~
@591  = ~I never really understood how magic worked. You say a few cryptic words, toss some bat poop, and next thing you know a big ball of fire is streaking at your enemies and exploding.~ [NOSOUND]
@592  = ~I guess it does seem pretty mysterious. To tell the truth, I don't really know how it works either. I just know that it does. Gorion taught me to cast spells, and they worked.~
@593  = ~Well, I channel and manipulate the magical forces by way of what we call the Weave. It is sort of like the threads that connect a mage to magic. It is hard to understand without direct experience, unfortunately.~
@594  = ~I ask myself that same question whenever I toss a fireball. Someday I think I'm going to mispronounce a word and turn myself into a rabbit or some such.~
@595  = ~Magic just works. That's all I know. Why bother asking why, as long as it keeps working?~
@596  = ~I suppose next you'll want me to ask how you manage to hack heads off while swinging those pieces of metal? Just leave this topic alone, Chloe.~
@597  = ~Or in your case, you just wave your finger and boom, roasted kobold for supper.~
@598  = ~I ask myself that same question whenever I toss a fireball. For me, it is just a matter of instinct, I suppose. Though I am at times paranoid I shall accidentally turn myself into a rabbit or some such.~
@599  = ~Touchy. As you like it, mage.~
@600  = ~I suppose you're right. It's just idle curiosity, is all.~
@601  = ~(laugh) I suppose it is a dangerous profession at times. Just don't turn *me* into a rabbit. I never became interested in magic for my own use. I doubt I have the mind for it anyway.~
@602  = ~You're fairly intelligent but it does take a certain kind of mind to grasp magic. But then it takes a different kind of magic to grasp melee. I could never fight like you do.~
@603  = ~I think you could handle magic if you tried. I guess if you don't have an interest in it, there's no reason to bother trying, though.~
@604  = ~Yeah. No offense, but I think it best you stick to swinging the sword around and leave the magery to those who can handle such.~
@605  = ~I can teach you how to make people's clothes disappear or their hair to turn strange colors. It makes for a great time!~
@606  = ~Yeah, you are a bit on the dull-witted side. You'd blow yourself up the first time you tried to cast a spell.~
@607  = ~You're too stupid to cast spells anyway. You'd kill us all trying to cast infravision.~
@608  = ~A simple "I agree, stick with the sword" would have been more than enough, mage.~
@609  = ~And so nicely put, as well. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for that lovely sentiment.~
@610  = ~Heh... I'll pass, thank you. I prefer making people's clothing disappear the old fashioned way.~
@611  = ~Of course.~
@612  = ~Right. Well, it's nice of you to say, regardless.~
@613  = ~You'd be surprised. If you were raised since you were barely old enough to stand to hold a sword and fight, you'd grow up having the right kind of mind. I don't know if you'd still have the raw talent for magic, though. I guess it's impossible to know.~
@614  = ~So why did you decide to become a mage? You said that Gorion was a mage, because of him I assume?~
@615  = ~Yes. Gorion taught me the secrets of magic. I don't know how I would have gotten along without him.~
@616  = ~Yes and no. I would have become a mage anyway because that is where my interest lies. But it was good to have such a wise and powerful mage as my instructor.~
@617  = ~I guess so. Nothing else really interested me enough to pursue, so it seemed the best.~
@618  = ~Well, I had to learn how to control my powers. Every time I sneezed a magic missile flew out!~
@619  = ~The magic came without intent, so it was learn to use it or blow myself up with a fireball. I don't especially like it, but I've learned to live with it.~
@620  = ~I became a mage because I wanted to. Gorion was secondary to my interests.~
@621  = ~Can we not talk about this?~
@622  = ~I started learning from books. When I set the library in the Keep on fire, my parents decided to get me a tutor. (Giggle)~
@623  = ~So that's why you became a mage? Because of Gorion?~
@624  = ~If that's what you want. Sorry to bother you.~
@625  = ~Oh. Well... ok. How pleasant.~
@626  = ~Ah. I guess that's the best you can hope for then.~
@627  = ~(laugh) Well, I'm glad you got a handle on it. It must have been scary for a while. I hope you're satisfied with your skills now.~
@628  = ~Well, as long as you're satisfied with it.~
@629  = ~That's good. I sometimes wonder what skills I would have wanted to learn had I not been raised as a Yr'kai. I'm happy that you knew what you were interested in and had the means to pursue it.~
@630  = ~That's sweet. I'm happy for you that you've followed in your father's footsteps.~
@631  = ~It must be pretty convenient to be able to do a little bit of everything.~ [NOSOUND]
@632  = ~Yes, it sure is. Especially when you find yourself in a party without certain key skills present.~
@633  = ~It is useful I suppose.~
@634  = ~Sometimes I think I should have just stuck with one thing. It takes forever to gain any skill.~
@635  = ~Yes, now if only I could get the lid off these damn iron rations, I'd feel it was worth something...~
@636  = ~It must be pretty convenient to have such a penchant for the obvious.~
@637  = ~Yes, I suppose it is at that. Such as letting you know how much of a jerk you can be at times.~
@638  = ~(laugh) Here, let me help you with that, <CHARNAME>.~
@639  = ~Everything has its advantages and disadvantages I suppose. It just takes patience. I know, you know that. I won't say anything more about. (grin)~
@640  = ~Ok...~
@641  = ~Did you have a particular reason for wanting to dabble in different things, or did it just end up that way?~
@642  = ~I wanted to be able to take care of myself no matter what situation I found myself in.~
@643  = ~I couldn't bring myself to commit to just one skill. I like to dabble too much.~
@644  = ~I'm pretty indecisive, actually. I didn't want to decide on just one set of skills to focus on, so I ended up just having to learn several.~
@645  = ~Oh you know... a well-rounded person is a healthy person. Or was it overweight? Or both? Wait... let me think about this one...~
@646  = ~Because often if I want things done right I have to do them myself, alright? Sheesh.~
@647  = ~(laughs) Ok, <CHARNAME>. I get it.~
@648  = ~It worries me that our fearless leader admits to being indecisive...~
@649  = ~Hmm. I wonder if that tendency to dabble extends to other choices, as well. Anyway, let's get going. I'm beginning to gather dust.~
@650  = ~An admirable goal, I must admit. It takes a special kind of mind to have so many skills to work on. Good luck with that. (snickers softly)~
@651  = ~You still give me strange looks occasionally when I go into battle. I'm assuming it's because I don't wear armor?~ [CHLEOGP9]
@652  = ~Yes, why don't you at least wear leather? It would protect you a bit and not restrict your movement that much.~
@653  = ~Yes, I wonder about your sanity when you rush into battle with nothing but tunic and britches.~
@654  = ~Actually I'm more concerned with your lack of taking your turn in cooking the meals when we camp.~
@655  = ~You don't wear armor!? I hadn't noticed. Why in the hells not, woman!?~
@656  = ~I just think you're funny looking. Now leave me be please.~
@657  = ~Perhaps it's because <PRO_HESHE> believes you to be insane, my lady. A belief I find myself considering.~
@658  = ~You've obviously never looked into a mirror, <CHARNAME>.~
@659  = ~You hadn't noticed?! By the gods, <PRO_MANWOMAN>, are you blind?! I have serious doubts about you sometimes.~
@660  = ~I just cooked rabbit stew like a week ago. If you want me to cook more often, I will. It's no trouble. I thought that perhaps the grimaces as you all ate it was to discourage me from continuing to help with the cooking. My mistake.~
@661  = ~But lumbering forward under the weight of metal that weighs more than I do and swinging around a weapon at snail pace and being too weighed down and slow to dodge so I just have to stand there and hope the enemies weapon doesn't get through my armor, that seems sane?~
@662  = ~Um... yes.~
@663  = ~I see your point. I just get concerned that you'll be injured badly where armor would have saved your life, that is all.~
@664  = ~I don't think being in armor is all that bad. You get accustomed to the weight and it doesn't slow too terribly much.~
@665  = ~You could rush into battle naked... that would be quite a sight to behold. Yes indeed it would...~
@666  = ~You're crazy and that is all there is to it. When you get sliced up like a midwinter ham, remember that you were advised that wearing armor is a healthy habit to get in to.~
@667  = ~Well, then I choose to be insane, my friend.~
@668  = ~Trust in my skills. You would also think the same thing if I started wearing heavy restrictive armor and I was too slow to dodge a blow that I normally would dance around, and was slain by it. Either way, you worry about your companions. Think of it not, <CHARNAME>. (smile)~
@669  = ~It slows enough that I've slain many opponents who died because they were too slow to avoid my blade. But, choose to believe what you will, it matters not.~
@670  = ~Well, now that I feel thoroughly dirty, I'll go over here and let you finish your lecherous thoughts in peace.~
@671  = ~Right... well whatever helps you sleep at night.~
@672  = ~I disagree. My fighting is based on skill and speed, not hoping that some metal or animal hide will deflect a blow I'm too slow and lazy to dodge. Loose clothing is ideal for this, and that is why the kensai warriors fight without armor. It's a little more dangerous, yes, but relying on one's own skill and speed to survive is worth it. It's a choice, really, of how one feels it best to fight. (shrug) Anyway, don't be too concerned with me, I'm pretty quick and it takes a lot to take me down.~
@673  = ~It's nice to see the fighting style of the kensai outside of the Yr'kai tribe. May I ask why you decided to pursue it?~ [NOSOUND]
@674  = ~I've always been fast and I prefer dodging blows rather than taking the hits. And of course, armor just slowed me down. I guess it was just natural to pursue the way of the kensai.~
@675  = ~I like fighting with a sword but I couldn't stand the armor. I felt like I was suffocating whenever I put it on. So, it was an easy decision.~
@676  = ~The armor was itchy so I just went without it.~
@677  = ~Well, I went to sign up for the warrior class and it was filled up! Can you believe it? So I look over and see this guy sitting there with just a sword and no armor and had a sign that said "Kensai class" and so I figured why not? Plus there was this cute...~
@678  = ~Actually I just couldn't afford the armor. Let's not talk about it though, it's embarrassing.~
@679  = ~Alright... have it your way.~
@680  = ~Ok, ok. No need to go further on that one. (laugh) Well, regardless of how you ended up a kensai, you're pretty good at it so I'm happy for you.~
@681  = ~Oh. Um... ok.~
@682  = ~I see. I can believe it, armor doesn't look terribly comfortable. I'm glad you are comfortable with your decision.~
@683  = ~Well, it's refreshing to see. I think it suits you, <CHARNAME>. (smile)~
@684  = ~How do you feel about Bhaal being your father?~ [CHLOEG10]
@685  = ~I hate it. He was the god of murder! How much worse can that get?~
@686  = ~Well, I've grown accustomed to it. I don't like it, but it doesn't bother me as much as it did in the past.~
@687  = ~I'm still holding out hope that this whole Bhaal stuff is false. I mean, I look kind of like this old shepherd that lived near Candlekeep... maybe *he* was my father and didn't want me so they made up all that Bhaal nonsense...~
@688  = ~What if Bhaal was really the god of chickens, or the god of doorknobs? I mean really, just because people thought he was the god of murder doesn't mean he actually was... right? You never know.~
@689  = ~I rather like it, actually. I get to kill stuff, I have these awesome powers. And people think I'm more interesting once they find out about my divine blood. It's all been great so far. (smile)~
@690  = ~How would *you* feel about it? It's horrible. Now leave me alone, I never want to ever think about Bhaal being my father again!~
@691  = ~Well, I think it's unhealthy to not deal with it, but I will respect your wishes.~
@692  = ~I um... I'm sorry I asked.~
@693  = ~I'm not even sure how to respond to that, so I'll just be quiet...~
@694  = ~I understand that. A part of me held out hope that I was just a normal human with no divine blood... right up until Akadia appeared before me and called me "Beloved daughter". That pretty much made me a believer. But I suppose you'll never have that... ah well. If you can hold out hope, I don't see a reason not to.~
@695  = ~I find myself wondering if you get your murderous impulses because you are a child of Bhaal, or if in fact you get them because you *know* you're a child of Bhaal, and of course you'd get murderous impulses...~
@696  = ~That's silly! Any child of Bhaal would go through dealing with suppressing the desire to murder, or they'd snap and go on a killing spree. The desire is just too strong to not notice.~
@697  = ~I suppose it's a possibility. I don't like the thought that this murderous rage might only be there because I'm excusing it as a trait of being a Bhaalspawn, though.~
@698  = ~You're right. It is worth wondering about. I wish I knew. Perhaps if I didn't know about my Bhaal essence I wouldn't feel compelled to harm people. That would truly be a blessing.~
@699  = ~Hey, why was Bhaal so cranky?~
@700  = ~Because his armor was on backwards!~
@701  = ~Because Mrs. Bhaal gave him a pink tunic to wear while he was working!~
@702  = ~Because he had a headache, and boy was it murder!~
@703  = ~He wanted to be the god of humor, but apparently all his jokes fell on a dead crowd!~
@704  = ~Um... if you say so.~
@705  = ~... So? Nevermind, I'd rather not know.~
@706  = ~Are you feeling well? You look a little flushed. Perhaps we should take you to a temple...~
@707  = ~Sounds familiar. Nice try though.~
@708  = ~I can only imagine what you're going through. I imagine Imoen being captured only makes it more difficult to control. But you're doing a damned fine job of it. Be confident in your own will to control yourself.~
@709  = ~I imagine it does make it easier to rationalize it away as normal. You're doing a good job of not going on a murderous rampage though. I'd hate to be hunted by every authority in Amn because you stubbed a toe and beheaded 12 people who happened to be standing close by, after all.~
@710  = ~Perhaps. You'd know better than me, of course. I guess it's pointless to wonder about it. We'll never know, either way. But before you left Candlekeep you didn't even know about your Bhaal essence. Perhaps you always felt the urge to kill people even then? I suppose hindsight will interfere in your memories, however.~
@711  = ~I'm sorry, was I disturbing you? I was praying to Akadia and Lathandar.~ [CHLOEG11]
@712  = ~No, not at all. I'm curious though, why do you worship both Akadia and Lathander?~
@713  = ~Praying? I thought you were talking to someone.~
@714  = ~Yes, I noticed that. Can you ask them to send us some better tasting rations?~
@715  = ~Yes, you were disturbing me, actually.~
@716  = ~Then just don't listen to me, nar'locth!~
@717  = ~Perhaps some tasty elven wine and some beautiful serving wenches as well? It doesn't hurt to ask, after all. (grin)~
@718  = ~I was. I was talking to my gods.~
@719  = ~Right... so, why do your people worship both Akadia and Lathander?~
@720  = ~And they answer back?~
@721  = ~Oh, is that all?~
@722  = ~Yes, that is all.~
@723  = ~Sometimes, yes. Now if you'll excuse me, I will finish my prayer and then we can continue our quest.~
@724  = ~Our historians tell us that Akadia and Lathandar both chose the Yr'kai as their favored people, for divine protection and special favors both ways and what not.~
@725  = ~The problem being, of course, that they *both* chose us. Their creatures, their priests and even their followers fought skirmishes and they argued and bargained for years.~
@726  = ~The Yr'kai were confused over this fighting over them. They beseeched Akadia and Lathandar to speak with them, to let them decide who their patron deity would be.~
@727  = ~Go on, please.~
@728  = ~Ok, ok. I've heard enough. This story is dragging on a bit long.~
@729  = ~Sorry, I guess the story isn't as interesting to an outsider as it is to my people.~
@730  = ~Grudgingly, they agreed and appeared before the Yr'kai in their avatar forms and asked what the decision of the Yr'kai was as to whom their patron deity would be.~
@731  = ~They asked then what each god would grant them if they were chosen as their patron deity. Lathandar promised to give the Yr'kai youth and vitality until the end of their days and a drive for self-perfection.~
@732  = ~Akadia, however, promised that the Yr'kai would be faster and more skilled in combat than any other human tribe. The denizens of air would be their allies, as well. But the Yr'kai could not decide. Am I boring you yet?~
@733  = ~No. Please continue. What happened then?~
@734  = ~A bit. I'm sorry. I really don't have any desire to hear more of this.~
@735  = ~Ok. Don't worry about it.~
@736  = ~One of the Yr'kai, a young girl, was confused by this decision. She asked a simple child's question. Why could they not both be our patrons, and we would worship them both equally?~
@737  = ~Akadia and Lathandar laughed the girl's question away at first, but the elders of the Yr'kai saw the wisdom in it. They repeated the question, with all seriousness. They promised that not only would all Yr'kai worship both gods equally, but all Yr'kai would be priests of both gods, an unprecedented amount of faith for any god, and still quite a bit for two.~
@738  = ~Oh, this is a fascinating story! W-what happened then, Chloe?~
@739  = ~And so they agreed, and even promised a gift in the future. The nature of which we do not know yet, if the story is even true. That is how we came to worship both Akadia and Lathandar. Thank you for allowing me to tell it.~
@740  = ~I told you about my rite of passage into adulthood, did I not? The Klaiuth'ka'nei?~ [CHLOEG12]
@741  = ~Erm... yes, the kliath... er... kluth... um... the rite of passage. I remember you telling me about it.~
@742  = ~Actually I believe I rudely and abruptly interrupted you when you tried. Shame on me.~
@743  = ~Is that the story you were telling me about with you and that fletcher's daughter and your drunken hedonistic lovefest in New Phlan?~
@744  = ~Yes, yes. Can I not hear about it again, please?~
@745  = ~Actually I was going to talk about how I gained my swords from my gods, but I guess you're not in a very talkative mood. Oh well.~
@746  = ~(laugh) No. And remind me not to drink more than one goblet of wine if I told you *that* story. I was referring to my ritual combat to gain adulthood?~
@747  = ~Oh yeah... that. What about it?~
@748  = ~But we're going to talk more about your exploits in New Phlan, aren't we? I'll get some wine...~
@749  = ~Ugh. Not that again. If you're going to talk my ear off, at least do it with a half-decent story.~
@750  = ~Alright. There once was a Yr'kai warrior who slapped a Bhaalspawn around for being a jac'ralisse! Now if you don't want a demonstration of that story, shut the blaers up and leave me alone!~
@751  = ~Oh, how subtle. Nice try, <CHARNAME>.~
@752  = ~Ah, yes. Of course. I sometimes convince myself that you're not as rude as you are, but then you remind me. Now, would you like to hear about how I gained the favor of my gods, or will you be telling me to stay my tongue once more?~
@753  = ~I'll listen. Please, tell me your story.~
@754  = ~Mmm... tongue...~
@755  = ~Actually yes, I would prefer you kept your tale to yourself.~
@756  = ~If you insist.~
@757  = ~(cough) Excuse me?~
@758  = ~Oh... was that out loud? Oops...~
@759  = ~I'm thinking about your tongue... my thoughts are rather impure right now. Does that bother you?~
@760  = ~Oh... I um... bit my tongue. (cough) I was about to ask you to tell me your story, so please do if you don't mind.~
@761  = ~I think I'll um... talk to someone else. I wonder about you sometimes, <CHARNAME>.~
@762  = ~What bothers me is that you'd actually tell me that! Keep your thoughts to yourself, I'd prefer to remain in ignorance on what goes on inside your head, <CHARNAME>.~
@763  = ~When I succeeded in my rite of passage I was visited by my mother Akadia for the first time in my life. She bestowed upon me this scimitar and told me that she was proud of me and that my accomplishments would have a great purpose someday.~
@764  = ~And Lathander? How did you gain his favor?~
@765  = ~For what purpose?~
@766  = ~She didn't happen to give you a Super-Powered Mage Slayer Rod as well, did she?~
@767  = ~(cough) Well, whatever. Let's get going again, I'm getting bored.~
@768  = ~Well, if you had a nice head injury you'd never be bored. Jiel'th liech tsauhla.~
@769  = ~Not a rod, just a sword. Though, hopefully it'll carve a hole in Irenicus's belly, regardless.~
@770  = ~She was impressed with my skills, and because I'm her daugher. Beyond that she did not tell me so it would only be a guess.~
@771  = ~So guess.~
@772  = ~Maybe she just saw a mortal guy and found him attractive and you were the surprise result, and she dumped you onto the Yr'kai and claimed you had this lofty important goal in life and didn't say what it was because it didn't really exist?~
@773  = ~Oh. Whatever. Time to get going.~
@774  = ~I suppose it is possible. Whether or not it is so, I would prefer you keep any future conjectures about my mother to yourself.~
@775  = ~Ok. I'm meant to kill any Bhaalspawn I happen upon, because they like to kill people.~
@776  = ~(cough) Uhh...~
@777  = ~I think I prefer "meant to save the realm" or something nice like that...~
@778  = ~Slay me then, good lady, and make it quick! I pray that thy fair heart will remember this humble companion with fondness! (grin)~
@779  = ~Oh please. Spare me your lame jokes.~
@780  = ~Someone is feeling grumpy today. Poor baby.~
@781  = ~(Advances to stab <CHARNAME>...)~ [NOSOUND]
@782  = ~C-Chloe!~
@783  = ~I have an interest in this male. Desist your foolish attack, rivvil!~
@784  = ~I have an interest in this female. Desist your foolish attack, rivvil!~
@785  = ~(Stops at the last moment)~
@786  = ~Ah, I think I'll let you live for now. You amuse me with your foolishness.~
@787  = ~My thanks, fair lady. Pray turn but a moment and allow me to inspect my breeches...~
@788  = ~Holy gods of Arcadia, I thought you were really going to run me through! I think it best I walk over here for the rest of the day...~
@789  = ~You really make me angry sometimes.~
@790  = ~Indeed. You are both rather amusing, at times.~
@791  = ~(Giggle)~
@792  = ~I never realized you were so sensitive. It was just a joke.~
@793  = ~Bah, you big baby.~
@794  = ~(laugh)~
@795  = ~Works for me.~
@796  = ~Well, you *did* ask.~
@797  = ~By my 17th winter I had become the most skilled torque in my village. I had dedicated a particularly grueling practice to him and he appeared before me and granted this sword to me. I'm guessing my kinship to Akadia was what had him interested in me. Or perhaps both he and Akadia know something of my future? We shall see what unfolds, I suppose.~
@798  = ~That's not very... detailed. He didn't tell you why he gave you the sword?~
@799  = ~Such mystery. Perhaps we shall find out why he gave you such a gift someday.~
@800  = ~Perhaps he was sweet on you? (wink)~
@801  = ~Well... ok. Let's get moving then, shall we?~
@802  = ~I wonder why he didn't give it to someone more worthy.~
@803  = ~So I'm not worthy? I would assume that is his call to make, for he is the deity and all. Enough of this, let us get moving.~
@804  = ~(laugh) Though I suppose it's possible, I hardly think it likely. But no matter. Let's get moving again, my legs are getting stiff from standing around.~
@805  = ~I certainly hope so.~
@806  = ~No, he just told me it would serve me well one day and disappeared. Strange, I know. Perhaps one day I'll discover why. Until then, we've nothing to do but continue on our current journey.~
@807  = ~So tell me <CHARNAME>, do you think there is a purpose to your divinity? A responsibility to either the mortal world or perhaps even the godly realms?~ [CHLOEG13]
@808  = ~I feel that my power does give me a certain responsibility to affect the world around me. I have the power to help people out so I do. Beyond that, I am not sure.~
@809  = ~I don't think it gives me any more responsibility than anyone else, really. I'm adventuring more out of necessity than desire. I'd be happy to return to a quiet life.~
@810  = ~The only responsibility I have is to take care of myself and anyone I care about.~
@811  = ~I think I have a responsibility to share my body with the world. So many people to please... so little time.~
@812  = ~My responsibility is to conquer this world and make it my own. And I have the power to do so.~
@813  = ~No.~
@814  = ~<PRO_HISHER> only responsibility is to do as <PRO_HESHE> pleases, rivvil. As is yours or mine.~
@815  = ~Viconia is right. I don't think it gives me any more responsibility than anyone else, really. I'm adventuring more out of necessity than desire. I'd be happy to return to a quiet life.~
@816  = ~You are right, Viconia. The only responsibility I have is to take care of myself and anyone I care about.~
@817  = ~... Ok. Nevermind then.~
@818  = ~Perhaps...~
@819  = ~Surely you are not serious, <CHARNAME>!?~
@820  = ~Such ambition in a male is... disgusting. You should know your place, <CHARNAME>, and that is at my feet!~
@821  = ~Har har, <CHARNAME>, why bother with ruling when it's much more fun to just cut your enemies down and have yer way with their women?~
@822  = ~What is the point though? You'd just make an endless score of enemies and probably be killed by poisoned food within a month.~
@823  = ~Then I shall slay any enemies I make.~
@824  = ~And while I ruled I would be happy and powerful. People would tremble before me and my name would be spoken in frightened whispers.~
@825  = ~I suppose you're right. What is the alternative though?~
@826  = ~I suppose simply doing what good one can while alive. Even if it is only for a few close friends, it is enough. I don't have the answers any more than anyone else. (shrug) We'll both think on it more, then.~
@827  = ~And then you would be dead, and you would be forgotten. Power over others that is not freely given is always temporary, even if you manage to survive for a long time. What good is worldly power to a corpse?~
@828  = ~Everyone dies. One may as well gain as much worldly power while alive and leave a legacy they will be remembered for all time for.~
@829  = ~What alternative is there?~
@830  = ~It beats raising cattle.~
@831  = ~Well that is my choice and that is all there is to it.~
@832  = ~Good luck, then. You shall need it.~
@833  = ~Hah... true, but there are other alternatives. No matter though, let us get going again. I'll let you think about this a while longer.~
@834  = ~I'm not sure whether that's the wisest or most depressing thing I've ever heard. I'm leaning towards depressing, however.~
@835  = ~So when everyone in the world is dead and you rule over a kingdom of corpses, what shall you do then?~
@836  = ~I don't think everyone would oppose me. I'd only have to slay a few and the rest would be cowed into submission.~
@837  = ~I would seek godhood then and leave the mortal world be.~
@838  = ~I hadn't thought of that. I'll worry about it when it comes about, then.~
@839  = ~Putting off until tomorrow what should be considered today is the surest route to one's own demise. Good luck with that.~
@840  = ~I see. Ambitious, I suppose. I wonder how you would fare as the new god of murder. It's not a job I would want, but to each their own.~
@841  = ~But you would always have enemies. Kings always do. And they would never stop trying to kill or depose you. You'd never have a moment of peace in your entire life.~
@842  = ~I can live with that.~
@843  = ~I hadn't thought of that. I'll worry about it when the comes about, then.~
@844  = ~Could you? I think it a bit naive to say so, but that is your choice, after all.~
@845  = ~(laugh) Well, I've been doing my best in that matter already. We shall have to bear our responsibility with all due seriousness and determination then. (smile)~
@846  = ~I suppose you're right. Perhaps I over think things sometimes. It's pointless to worry about things one cannot know or change, I suppose.~
@847  = ~ So when all this business with Irenicus is over, you will try to return to a quiet life, if you are able?~
@848  = ~Yes. It's worth an attempt, after all.~
@849  = ~Given my nature, I have little hope that I will ever be able to settle down. However, I will always wish for a more quiet life. But, if I am to be a hero, I will be a hero, however reluctant.~
@850  = ~Given my nature, I have little hope that I will ever be able to settle down. However, I will always wish for a more quiet life. But, if I am to be a heroine, I will be a heroine, however reluctant.~
@851  = ~I guess so.~
@852  = ~Perhaps no so quiet. I might live a life of revelry. Maybe I shall become a Priest of Sharess...~
@853  = ~Perhaps no so quiet. I might live a life of revelry. Maybe I shall become a Priestess of Sharess...~
@854  = ~I would love to just become a farmer.~
@855  = ~How... interesting. I guess.~
@856  = ~So rather than a quiet humble life you'd become a lust-seeker? I suppose it'd be an enjoyable retirement from adventuring. I wonder if you could live on lust alone and no love, though. No matter.~
@857  = ~Well... good luck with that then.~
@858  = ~A reluctant hero? I suppose it is as good a life to lead as any. I am not reluctant, but I've never considered myself a heroine either. No matter, life is what you make of it I suppose.~
@859  = ~A reluctant heroine? I suppose it is as good a life to lead as any. I am not reluctant, but I've never considered myself a heroine either. No matter, life is what you make of it I suppose.~
@860  = ~I see. I don't think I will ever settle down. The future is so uncertain though, so I should not say it will never happen. We shall see.~
@861  = ~I suppose that is as good a reason to live as any. The matter has been on my mind of late. Time was I would never have joined this quest without a fair bit of coin coming my way. But now I find myself wanting to aid you in your quest, regardless of what I may gain from it.~
@862  = ~Why? Not that I'm complaining, of course.~
@863  = ~ It's my charm. People just can't help themselves around me. (smile)~
@864  = ~And I appreciate your help.~
@865  = ~I'd do just as well without your help, but I appreciate it anyway.~
@866  = ~So nice to feel appreciated.~
@867  = ~Thank you.~
@868  = ~(chuckle) Dream on, <CHARNAME>.~
@869  = ~I'm not sure. It bothered me more than I care to admit to see Imoen stolen away like she was simply for trying to free herself from that mage. And your quest to rescue her and to end the life of that wizard is a valiant one.~
@870  = ~I think, perhaps, you meant foolish, Chloe.~
@871  = ~One that I find myself proud to be a part of. Perhaps I am getting soft. Regardless, let's get moving again.~
@872  = ~You look a bit down. Tell me a funny story about yourself and Imoen from when you were growing up in Candlekeep, if you don't mind? Perhaps it will cheer you up.~ [CHLOEG14]
@873  = ~Alright. A number of years ago we were hiding in the library. Gorion was expecting us for lessons but we were in a playful mood.~
@874  = ~Ok. One time Gorion made the mistake of trying to teach Imoen how to cast a magic missile. This was before she took up her mage studies, by the way.~
@875  = ~Sure... let's see. We were outside one day, occupying ourselves quietly as the monks meditated.~
@876  = ~I can't really think of any right now. I'm not really in the mood for a story anyway. Perhaps another time.~
@877  = ~Leave me alone. I'm not in the mood.~
@878  = ~Fine. Excuse me for trying to cheer you up. I'll know better next time.~
@879  = ~I understand. I just thought it might cheer you up, is all.~
@880  = ~Quietly? Heh... *sure* you were.~
@881  = ~So we were having fun sneaking up behind a monk and then scurrying away, trying not to get noticed.~
@882  = ~Go on.~
@883  = ~Immy had somehow gotten a hold of a squirrel, and I hadn't noticed it as I snuck up behind Gorion...~
@884  = ~Uh oh...~
@885  = ~Exactly. Next thing I know I have a panicked animal down my britches! I'm hollering and rolling around and frightened, I didn't know what was going on.~
@886  = ~Boo has a tendency to scurry in unexpected places at times as well. Minsc does not always realize what is going on...~
@887  = ~Oh boy...~
@888  = ~So next thing I know my tunic catches on fire, because I had frightened Gorion and he had cast a flame arrow before he realized it was me...~
@889  = ~Ouch!~
@890  = ~Uh huh. So, needless to say I had to take a trip to the healers... and ever since then Immy occasionally teases me by calling me Squirrelly-pants. (sigh)~
@891  = ~(laugh) That's funny. Thanks, <CHARNAME>.~
@892  = ~Reminds me of when I thought I was just starting to learn and I thought I was casting an invisibility spell... instead I accidentally casted blindness on myself. I nearly fell out of the window in the library in my panic. (Chuckle)~
@893  = ~Yeah, so she's trying to cast and suddenly Gorion gets polymorphed into a weasel!~
@894  = ~Oh my!~
@895  = ~So Immy was scrambling to find a reversal spell, yelling at me in hysterics that it was all my fault.~
@896  = ~(smile)~
@897  = ~Gorion the weasel was running around so I had to try to catch him while Immy tore through scrolls like there was no tomorrow. I finally caught him and Immy found the reversal spell.~
@898  = ~Did it work?~
@899  = ~Sort of. He was turned back into a human... but he was a woman! Not a bad looking one either. (laugh)~
@900  = ~(laugh) He must have been furious!~
@901  = ~At first he was just mildly annoyed... then he saw a mirror. Gorion ceased trying to teach her magic, deeming her a lost cause.~
@902  = ~(laugh) Well, if only he could see her now. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I enjoyed that story.~
@903  = ~So we were playing hide and seek for a while. I couldn't find Imoen though. Even then she was a master of hiding.~
@904  = ~(chuckle) I'm not surprised. Go on, please.~
@905  = ~I figured she must have left the library, even though we had agreed not to. So I snuck out, looking for her.~
@906  = ~Did you find her?~
@907  = ~No, but I did find Gorion, who was searching for us. As I was standing there being scolded for skipping lessons, I saw Imoen poke her head out of the library then she climbed out a window.~
@908  = ~Ouch, she left you there to face Gorion on your own?~
@909  = ~Yes, the little rascal. So to get her back I put a frog in her bed. She ran out of her room with barely a stitch on screaming that a monster had attacked her in bed!~
@910  = ~When she found out that it was just a frog, she played some *mean* pranks on me for a good month or two. But it was worth it to see the look on her face. (chuckle)~
@911  = ~(laugh) Thanks, <CHARNAME>. That was funny.~
@912  = ~What do you fear the most, <CHARNAME>?~ [CHLOEG15]
@913  = ~I'd have to say death.~
@914  = ~I'm scared of losing control of myself... giving in to my Bhaal nature and becoming a murderer.~
@915  = ~I'm afraid of failing my friends. Especially Imoen.~
@916  = ~I am afraid of being alone. I have never been without Gorion and Imoen, or traveling companions. Being lonely is worse than death.~
@917  = ~I'm scared of mice. They horrify me!~
@918  = ~I'm not afraid of anything.~
@919  = ~I'm frightened that you'll want to continue this conversation.~
@920  = ~Fine then. I'll leave you alone. You must enjoy being anti-social or something.~
@921  = ~Nothing? If you say so. You wouldn't understand then.~
@922  = ~Oh. I was going to get a pet mouse and name her Itchy. But, I'll set that plan aside for now, in respect. Ah well.~
@923  = ~I've been lonely more often than I care for. Sometimes even in a crowd one can feel lonely. But my greatest fear is of death, or rather what will happen to me after I die.~
@924  = ~What do you mean?~
@925  = ~Are you afraid you'll go to the hells or something?~
@926  = ~Right... what's for dinner tonight? Rations again?~
@927  = ~Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, we shall not fail Imoen. Not as long as we draw breath. Which leads into my fear... death. Or rather, what will happen to me after I die.~
@928  = ~I can certainly understand that fear, <CHARNAME>. My own fear is of death. Or rather, what will happen to me after I die.~
@929  = ~I agree...~
@930  = ~I.. I've been told that to truly live one must... not fear death.~
@931  = ~There are far worse things to fear than death, surfacers. I've been face to face with a few of them in my time and I wish to not repeat the experience.~
@932  = ~Cousin Jalthi claims he met death once. She was a cute little pale human girl that dressed in black and carried this strange cloth and steel contraption. She spoke in a strange manner and seemed quite happy. You'd think Death would be a bit more solemn and serious? Cousin Jalthi claimed he talked her ear straight off until she decided to let him live a while longer. Though he was deep in the turnip beer that night, so perhaps it was all a dream. Which reminds me of this dream I had last night where...~
@933  = ~Death is my greatest fear as well. Or rather, what will happen to me after death.~
@934  = ~For you? Most definitely. Unseasoned at that.~
@935  = ~No. I'm afraid that because I'm the child of a god that when I die my life force will simply become a part of Akadia again and I will cease to exist, as if I never had at all. That fear has woken me cold and sweating more times than I care to admit.~
@936  = ~I'm sure you'll share the same fate as any other Yr'kai. Maybe you'll even sit by Akadia's right hand or something.~
@937  = ~I see your point. That *is* scary.~
@938  = ~I'm glad I'm not you, then.~
@939  = ~I'm a child of a god. What if when I die I simply become a part of Akadia again and cease to exist altogether? Everything I've become... just gone. Nothing left. It scares me... It scares me a lot.~
@940  = ~Oh, but you should have the same concerns, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps when you die you'll simply become a part of Bhaal being reborn through the essence of all his progeny. He must've had a reason to have them, after all. I hope you sleep well tonight.~
@941  = ~Yes, I know.~
@942  = ~I certainly hope so. But I won't know until I actually die... and that scares me more than I care to admit. Thank you for listening though, I feel a lot better <CHARNAME>.~
@943  = ~You are rather attractive, <CHARNAME>. Has anyone ever told you this before?~ [CHLOEL1]
@944  = ~Sure, by lots of people. Normally they're trying to get something from me, but yes I have been told thus before.~
@945  = ~I may have been told thus before, yes. You flatter me with your kind words, Chloe.~
@946  = ~I believe there is a bar song in Baldur's Gate about something similar to that... though it is more crude than flattering.~
@947  = ~Oh... I am not that attractive. You are kind to say so, but perhaps you have taken a blow or two to the head. (shy smile)~
@948  = ~You flatter me, Chloe. But I sense there is a little more than friendly flattery behind your words. I do not want to lead you on, so I will let you know now that I am not interested and hope you do not take offense.~
@949  = ~Stop looking at me like that, Chloe. I'm not interested in your praise or your gaze. Look upon someone else.~
@950  = ~You needn't be so rude about it. I apologize if I have offended you. I thought perhaps my interest might be shared, but I see it is not. You could at least try to remain civil, regardless.~
@951  = ~I understand. It is not a problem, <CHARNAME>. Let us continue on then, my friend.~
@952  = ~Of course she has, she does not need the likes of you telling her thus, Chloe!~
@953  = ~Perhaps she has at that, fair lady, but she speaks the truth nevertheless. Though I advise caution against accepting such praise from one such as she.~
@954  = ~Surely such things are not true, however... <CHARNAME>?~
@955  = ~Perhaps I could say the same to you, if you think you are not lovely to behold. Or perhaps you have simply never gazed into a mirror? We shall have to remedy that situation.~
@956  = ~(blush) You're embarrassing me, Chloe.~
@957  = ~Perhaps you should compose a poem for me, so that I might believe your silvery words, Chloe.~
@958  = ~I looked into a mirror once and I was pried from it hours later by Gorion and Imoen. I had apparently fallen in love with the girl in the mirror. (grin)~
@959  = ~I was simply trying to ease you down gently. I have not the interest in you that you may have towards me. I am sorry, Chloe.~
@960  = ~Nothing to be sorry about. If you have no interest in me, than there is nothing to apologize for. It is simply so. Pay it no more heed.~
@961  = ~Hah! So you've been avoiding mirrors ever since. A wise choice, <CHARNAME>. Save the gazes of adoration for the rest of us.~
@962  = ~A poem? I can do that. Let's see... Your gaze is like a glittering coin, shining in the sun. Your beauty outshines the moon, when all is said and done. But all my words are simply flattery, and can never compare to your beauty. Your sharp mind and your sweet smile are not but simple guile, for nothing outside or in can compare to the fairness of your soul. My poem is thus simple and true, but more than meets it's goal.~
@963  = ~It's a bit rough, but it was on the spot, after all. (smile)~
@964  = ~It was very lovely. Thank you Chloe.~
@965  = ~Ouch... it was a bit rough. But the intent was sweet and you flatter me nonetheless.~
@966  = ~It was horrible. You obviously think me a fool. I have no interest in someone who cannot compose a simple poem, Chloe.~
@967  = ~I never claimed to be a poet. I tried my best. If that is not enough for you, then so be it. I'll not attempt such again.~
@968  = ~Then I accomplished my goal. I never claimed to be a poet, after all. (smile)~
@969  = ~You are most welcome, fair <CHARNAME>.~
@970  = ~I simply speak the truth, <CHARNAME>. But I will stay my tongue to save you further embarrassment.~
@971  = ~Oh? Perhaps I should pay a visit to Baldur's Gate soon. I find myself most curious about this song. (grin) Perhaps you will save me a trip perhaps and sing it for me?~
@972  = ~Uh... no. Let's just say it involves me, Sarevok, and various farm tools... and perhaps an animal or two as well. It is nothing you should concern yourself with.~
@973  = ~I would sing it but it has such foul language and ill-conceived ideas of anatomy that it is hardly worth repeating. Perhaps if I find myself deep in the cup I might find myself singing it. Oh, how embarrassing that would be. (wink)~
@974  = ~I don't want to talk about it. I'm sorry I even mentioned it. How embarrassing. I hope you do not think such things could be true of me!~
@975  = ~I'm sure they are not, do not worry. I think no ill of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@976  = ~Ha-ha... now where did I put that wineskin?~
@977  = ~Heh... as long as none of it is true. Else, I would deem a trip north to be worth considering. We shall talk later then, about something other than crude songs.~
@978  = ~I simply speak the truth. Perhaps we will talk of this again later.~
@979  = ~My... how jaded. I am not trying to gain anything but a smile, however. You needn't worry about any ulterior motives, <CHARNAME>.~
@980  = ~(smile) My thanks, then. I must confess you are rather attractive as well.~
@981  = ~I am flattered. Thank you, Chloe.~
@982  = ~I think you do have an ulterior motive. I am not offended, but I do not share your interest. My apologies if I have led you to believe otherwise.~
@983  = ~Of course you have an ulterior motive. I see how you look at me. You want to bed me. I'll have none of it, Chloe. Leave me be.~
@984  = ~I say, dear lady! I could not have stated it better had I said it myself!~
@985  = ~<CHARNAME>! Tell me that this woman has not enchanted you with her wiles!?~
@986  = ~My, how arrogant. And to think, all I did was pay you a simple compliment and you act as if I have sullied your honor. I shall leave you be and I trust you shall do the same.~
@987  = ~You are most welcome, <CHARNAME>.~
@988  = ~(grin) So kind of you to say, <CHARNAME>. We shall talk more of this later then.~
@989  = ~(Looks a bit pensive)~ [NOSOUND]
@990  = ~Chloe? Are you all right?~
@991  = ~Chloe? I wanted to give you this silver bracelet I picked up the last time we were in town. I think it will look lovely on you. (smile)~
@992  = ~What smells worse than an ogre's backside?~
@993  = ~(leave her alone)~
@994  = ~(glances at <CHARNAME> then sighs and looks back to the road)~
@995  = ~Hmm... what?~
@996  = ~An ogre's backside next to a troll's backside!~
@997  = ~A wet kobold!~
@998  = ~Minsc on a really hot day!~
@999  = ~You! Take a bath, Chloe!~
@1000 = ~How sweet of you to say. Stop by a bath house and I'd be more than glad to oblige. When we do visit the bathhouse, I suggest you partake of the services as well, my dear.~
@1001 = ~Minsc thinks you are trying to tell him something. Boo says you are just being mean, though.~
@1002 = ~(Chuckle) Don't worry, Minsc. <CHARNAME> is just trying to lighten the mood. Just smile at her. (grins at <CHARNAME>)~
@1003 = ~Ok... ha ha.~
@1004 = ~Not two ogres' backsides, huh? All right. (grin)~
@1005 = ~That's sweet of you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. (smiles and puts the bracelet on. It does indeed look quite striking on her)~
@1006 = ~I suppose so. I miss my village. It's been a long time since I've been home.~ [CHLOEL2]
@1007 = ~I understand. It's been quite a while since I've been back home to Candlekeep as well.~
@1008 = ~Why have you stayed away so long?~
@1009 = ~Perhaps we'll be able to take a trip up north to your village when all this business with the Cowled Wizards is over.~
@1010 = ~If you feel you have to leave the party to return home, I understand.~
@1011 = ~No. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, but my place is here for now. I just miss home, is all. I appreciate the consideration, though.~
@1012 = ~I'd like that, <CHARNAME>. (smile)~
@1013 = ~I'm not sure anymore. I think perhaps I did not want to return without feeling like a success. Like I've done more with my life than simply dubious mercenary jobs. Perhaps after your quest is over, I will feel like I have done something important and be ready to return home. I can only hope. (sad smile)~
@1014 = ~Perhaps after your quest is over we can visit both Candlekeep and La'risadiim, my village. (sad smile)~
@1015 = ~So how are you feeling this morning, <CHARNAME>?~ [CHLOEL3]
@1016 = ~Well enough, I suppose. How about yourself?~
@1017 = ~A little stiff, but otherwise just fine. I feel much better as I gaze upon your lovely face, though. (Smile)~
@1018 = ~Well, I feel good enough to fly. Oh wait, I just stood up too fast. Never mind. (grin)~
@1019 = ~Tired. Let's talk later, ok?~
@1020 = ~Ok, <CHARNAME>.~
@1021 = ~Steady then, my dear. Or shall I carry you upon my shoulder? I can't promise my hand won't wander though... (Wicked grin)~
@1022 = ~You're horrible! So... over the shoulder works for you, then?~
@1023 = ~Eek! (run away)~
@1024 = ~Perhaps another time.~
@1025 = ~I'll hold you to that, <CHARNAME>. (Evil smile)~
@1026 = ~You're not getting away that easily! (Laugh)~
@1027 = ~Yep... come to Chloe. (Grin)~
@1028 = ~Aww...~
@1029 = ~<CHARNAME>! What are you saying!? Surely you were speaking to me when you said such a thing...~
@1030 = ~Oh, that is so sweet, <CHARNAME>!~
@1031 = ~I feel quite ill, suddenly. Such surfacer nonsense disgusts me. Why don't you just take your pleasure from each other and be done with it and spare us your mewlings?~
@1032 = ~(Grin) Good to hear, <CHARNAME>. Looking back at you fills me with a sense of content, as well.~
@1033 = ~I'm feeling well. I was watching you while you slept. You seemed... agitated. Nightmares?~
@1034 = ~Yes... I was reliving my tortures at Irenicus's hands. I was also seeing Imoen getting tortured, though I had not seen that in real life.~
@1035 = ~I just couldn't get comfortable, is all.~
@1036 = ~I don't remember. Possibly.~
@1037 = ~I was dreaming about you. (Grin)~
@1038 = ~That's why you were mumbling "No, get away from me", I see? Hmm.~
@1039 = ~No... I was just being coy. I was dreaming about my stay in Irenicus's dungeon.~
@1040 = ~Was I? I don't really remember what I was dreaming about, to be truthful.~
@1041 = ~Yes. We were just um... playing a game. I will give no more details than that. (Blush)~
@1042 = ~Yes. A sign of how I truly feel, I think. I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable with your flirtation any more.~
@1043 = ~Oh? I'm sorry. I didn't realize you felt any differently about it. I will leave you alone, then.~
@1044 = ~Oh? Hmm, perhaps I'll have to pry more information about this from you. (Wicked smile) So, what were you wearing, what was I wearing, what were we doing, what was...~
@1045 = ~Well, whatever it was, it was pretty scary the way you were acting. I wish I could comfort you when that happens... Well, I don't want to embarrass you. Let's get going before the others start calling us lazy.~
@1046 = ~That makes sense. I imagine that time will haunt your dreams for a while yet. I wish I could offer you some comfort when things like this happen... Well, I don't want to embarrass you. Let's get going before the others start calling us lazy.~
@1047 = ~Ok. Well, whatever it was sounded pretty intense. It's probably best you don't remember it. Well let's get up and get going then.~
@1048 = ~It sounded like a bit more than that, but I won't press. I'll let you wake up so we can get back to our journey.~
@1049 = ~I can see the worry clouding your eyes during the waking hours and hear your restless slumber as well. I wish that I could do more to offer you comfort... We'll rescue Imoen from those wizards soon, and we'll celebrate once we return. I will do my best to help bring this about.~
@1050 = ~I see how much more at ease you are now that Imoen has been rescued, <CHARNAME>. I'm happy for you. (Smile)~ [CHLOEL4]
@1051 = ~It is a relief to have her by my side again and not have to worry about her. The loss of our souls is preying on my mind now, however.~
@1052 = ~Yes, it's a relief having her back among us. And now I can concentrate on my affection for you, my dear Chloe. (Smile)~
@1053 = ~Imoen? Who is that?~
@1054 = ~Yes... and I don't know how to say this... but I think the strain of Imoen's capture and trying to rescue her made my judgment a little lax. I don't feel quite the same way about you as I did before, Chloe. I'm sorry.~
@1055 = ~You're using me as a reason to break Chloe's heart? That's just harsh, <CHARNAME>.~
@1056 = ~Oh... this is unexpected. I suppose I understand. I'll respect your wishes then.~
@1057 = ~... Of course.~
@1058 = ~Hey! You want me to come over there, sis?! I'll remind ya who I am, all right! Soul or no, I can still kick your...~
@1059 = ~(snicker) I think you said the wrong thing, <CHARNAME>. I'll leave you two alone to sort this out.~
@1060 = ~I see. I had thought my affections returned but I see they have been misplaced. I will not butt my head in the way again, my ladies.~
@1061 = ~What, no hug for dear little sister? I can feel the love here.~
@1062 = ~(smile) I don't think she means that kind of affection, Immy. It's sweet of you to say, <CHARNAME>, however I think you should be more careful with how you say it in earshot of Imoen.~
@1063 = ~I'm not feeling too great either, here. We should hurry after Bodhi and Irenicus, it's our only chance.~
@1064 = ~We shall retake what was lost and have our revenge as well. Worry not, my friends. Balance shall be restored.~
@1065 = ~I agree. It's good to have you back Imoen, and I'm glad of the effect your return has on <CHARNAME>, despite the circumstances. We'll get your souls back and send those bastards straight to the abyss, as well.~
@1066 = ~Imoen, what was <CHARNAME> like as a child?~ [NOSOUND]
@1067 = ~She was a brat. A total pain in the backside. A complete buffle-headed...~
@1068 = ~Hey! I'm standing right here, you know.~
@1069 = ~You forgot cute, sweet, and the best sister a girl could have, Immy.~
@1070 = ~You forgot clumsy, oafish, and rude, Immy. (grin)~
@1071 = ~Imoen! Be quiet girl!~
@1072 = ~Oh, you're not that bad. (whispers something to Chloe)~
@1073 = ~(giggle)~
@1074 = ~Oh nothing. We're walking here...~
@1075 = ~It does sound like she's choking, doesn't it?~
@1076 = ~But you think it's cute anyway... right?~
@1077 = ~I make noises when I sleep?~
@1078 = ~Immy gets this weird gurgling noise in her stomach. Sounds like a sick dog...~
@1079 = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@1080 = ~Ok, there was this one time where this soldier boy...~
@1081 = ~Hey!~
@1082 = ~Oh no... not the soldier boy story! I'm going to get you Immy!~
@1083 = ~No, no. Tell her the story about when I fell down the well. That one is funnier.~
@1084 = ~You're no fun, <CHARNAME>.~
@1085 = ~<CHARNAME>, you... you shouldn't be so rude!~
@1086 = ~That's ok. We'll just talk about this later, Immy. (smile)~
@1087 = ~Yes... she is a damned good sister, at that. By the way, have you noticed how when she sleeps she makes this weird clucking noise with her tongue?~
@1088 = ~Oh, is that what that is!? I keep thinking she's choking on something. Scares me halfway to the abyss...~
@1089 = ~Ok, <CHARNAME>. We were just teasing you.~
@1090 = ~That's because I'm hungry, silly! Rations never quite satisfy my hunger.~
@1091 = ~I keep telling everyone to set some cheese and bread to the side too, but they don't listen. They think iron rations are the only thing they can eat on the road. (sigh)~
@1092 = ~I vote we head to a tavern soon and get a decent meal and a soft bed.~
@1093 = ~I'm up for that. I guess it's <CHARNAME>'s choice though. (sweet smile)~
@1094 = ~Ooooh yeah.~
@1095 = ~Only little ones...~
@1096 = ~Do not coddle her. Yes, <CHARNAME>, you make the disturbing sounds in your sleep. Now desist in your pointless babbling!~
@1097 = ~Don't worry about it, <CHARNAME>. You're cute anyway. (smile)~
@1098 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. (smile)~
@1099 = ~What's your point?~
@1100 = ~So, she was a sister, in other words. (grin) A good sister, though?~ [CHLOEL5]
@1101 = ~The best!~
@1102 = ~So tell me some embarrassing things about her.~
@1103 = ~Oh! Yes, the time you jumped down the well because you thought you saw a big gold coin down there but it was just the sun reflecting off the water! I had to drag Gorion down there to teleport you out! Ha ha!~
@1104 = ~You actually jumped down a well after a gold coin?! Ha! My, my... what am I going to do with you, my dear? (smile)~
@1105 = ~Aw, don't ruin our fun, <CHARNAME>. You can tell me an embarrassing story about Imoen later.~
@1106 = ~Exactly! So, <CHARNAME> was all over this soldier boy...~
@1107 = ~Tell me about it later, Immy. (grin)~
@1108 = ~Of course!~
@1109 = ~(giggle) <CHARNAME>, you're so cute. But let's get going again...~
@1110 = ~Hey! What'd she say?~
@1111 = ~Whatever she said isn't true!~
@1112 = ~Oh... how disappointing. Oh well.~
@1113 = ~We've done taken some mighty big losses here recently.~
@1114 = ~Yessir, firs the ship n' da cap'n gets slay'd, then we loses uh buncha men to duh lil boy. A yerka or som'in like dat?~
@1115 = ~Yessir, we's los a buncha men to duh lil boy. A yerka or som'in like dat?~
@1116 = ~Yeah, more trouble'n he was worth, if ye ask me. He done killed all dem men, an' only reason we gottem down was a sleepy spell from one of dem wizards.~
@1117 = ~Yessir. He migh' fetch a pretty copper if's we sells him to da gladiator pits. He be real pop'lar there, yessir!~
@1118 = ~Did... did he say Yr'kai, Chloe?~
@1119 = ~You there! Did you say that slave boy was from the Yr'kai tribe?~ [CHLOEL6]
@1120 = ~Who wan's ta know?~
@1121 = ~Those Yr'kai make damn good fighters. I could use a good gladiator for my father's fighting pits in Neverwinter. And a slave? Well we'd only have to give him food and drink. (laugh)~
@1122 = ~(Smile) Well, yes indeed he's a Yerka, or whatever dat was you done called 'im. Lemme know yer name and where's we can reach ya an' we'll get in touch to discuss da bis'nis. (Slimy smile)~
@1123 = ~Just tell me where I can find him. I want to have him purchased and on his way back home within a day or two.~
@1124 = ~Well I kin't rightly tell ya that, in case yer not on the level, missy.~
@1125 = ~You have one chance to live. Tell me where the boy is. Otherwise you'll have a blade sticking out of your leg before you can blink and I'll ask you again.~ [CHLOEL6B]
@1126 = ~Chloe! C-calm down... please?~
@1127 = ~I... I... I... I...~
@1128 = ~(Steps towards the man with a menacing gleam in her eye)~
@1129 = ~What's that you're saying?~ [NOSOUND]
@1130 = ~BRIDGE DISTRICT! TANNER'S OLD HOUSE! DON' KILL ME, PLEASE! Ah gots me a wife'n two kids! I mean... three kids! Yes ma'am she's carryin' one of em now!~
@1131 = ~Too bad for her that she married such a muck-rider, then. <CHARNAME>, let's go to the Bridge district and free that boy. He's one of my people.~ [CHLOEL6C]
@1132 = ~Chloe... I... I'm sorry. You should try to calm down, you... you're losing control.~
@1133 = ~Finally a party member with some backbone!~
@1134 = ~Chloe, I feel I cannot abide by your actions. I know you are upset but that man could have been spared! Regain control, or I shall be forced to take action!~
@1135 = ~I will not stand idly knowing this, let's go!~
@1136 = ~Of course, Chloe.~
@1137 = ~I don't think it's wise to get involved, Chloe.~
@1138 = ~I'll not risk my life for a stupid little boy that got caught by traders. Go by yourself if that's what you insist on doing.~
@1139 = ~Goodbye then. We shall not meet again if I have any say in the matter, you heartless bitch.~
@1140 = ~<CHARNAME>! If it were me in there you would rush to the rescue. You care about Chloe, you should care about this too. Come on, sis. Don't disappoint me here.~
@1141 = ~To the abyss with wisdom! This effects me personally. We go, or I go alone. It's your choice.~
@1142 = ~We'll go now, then.~
@1143 = ~You're on your own then.~
@1144 = ~We are supposed to go rescue the Yr'Kai boy, <CHARNAME>! I will not tolerate any further delay, we go to the old Tanner's House in the Bridge district *now*, or I go on my own.~ [NOSOUND]
@1145 = ~Enough. You haven't paid any heed to my words; I'll rescue that boy even if I have to do it alone. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~ [NOSOUND]
@1146 = ~The shop is closed. Haven't you heard? ... You don't look like you're here to buy leather goods.~
@1147 = ~I'm here for the Yr'kai boy. Release him to me and you will live. Release him not, and every one of you will die. Your cries for mercy will be ignored. Make your choice quickly.~ [CHLOEL7]
@1148 = ~Har har! Get em, boys!~
@1149 = ~Let's head downstairs. He's got to be here somewhere.~ [NOSOUND]
@1150 = ~What in blazes is going on up there? You woke us all... wait... Who are you? Intruders!~
@1151 = ~Your blood shall paint me in a haze of battle-paint, you stinking maggots! Feel Akadia's wrath!!!~
@1152 = ~Blast it! Where is he? Maybe he's down the stairs there. Let's go, <CHARNAME>.~ [NOSOUND]
@1153 = ~We have to get out of here. That noise above must mean we're being attacked by some nosey guards or something.~
@1154 = ~Hold, I sense we have company.~
@1155 = ~You there, what do you want here? Why are you attacking us?!~
@1156 = ~Where is the Yr'kai boy? Tell me or die!~
@1157 = ~The boy? We don't have him any more. A lady came and said her army had been searching for him when they attacked his village.~
@1158 = ~They said they killed everyone in that village. What interest could you possibly have in him?~
@1159 = ~I am a Yr'kai warrior. He is of my tribe. Wait... his village was destroyed?! Which... which village?~
@1160 = ~I have a paper here from the lady that came... Aros! Gate us out of here!~
@1161 = ~KLA'HIRAS! What could an army possibly want with a little boy!? <CHARNAME>, what does that paper there say? Maybe it is the one the commander was talking about.~ [NOSOUND]
@1162 = ~This... no... This is my village! Everyone... everyone I ever knew... is gone. I think I'm going to be sick... (Vomits into the water)~ [NOSOUND]
@1163 = ~I'm... I'm sorry for your loss, Chloe. I know how it feels to lose loved ones.~
@1164 = ~I grieve with you, Chloe. Tell me if there is anything you need, and I will do it.~
@1165 = ~I suppose you want to leave the group now.~
@1166 = ~So you cast me away like so much garbage, then? How can you be so cruel?~
@1167 = ~I did not mean it that way. I was simply offering you a chance to leave if you felt you had to. I am more than happy to have you remain amongst us. I will help you however I can.~
@1168 = ~You're of no use to me now. I'm sorry if it seems cruel, but you threaten my survival like this. I wish you well, Chloe.~
@1169 = ~And I wish you to suffer in eternal agony, you heartless ja'careth! You're lucky that Imoen is here with you, or I would kill you where you stand. Goodbye, Imoen. I hope <CHARNAME> doesn't toss you into the garbage like she did to me.~
@1170 = ~I need to rest and think about this. Can we please go to an inn for the night?~
@1171 = ~Of course. We'll go there now.~
@1172 = ~We have other matters to attend to. We'll rest later.~
@1173 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1174 = ~I am going with or without you. I am no good to you right now anyway. I need to clear my head. Now, are we going to rest or are you going to abandon me?~
@1175 = ~We'll rest. Let's head to an inn now.~
@1176 = ~No, we're continuing on, with or without you, Chloe. We've all suffered losses and had to go on with our lives.~
@1177 = ~Sorry I'm such a g'licau inconvenience, you heartless bitch. I'll take my leave of you now and forever then. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@1178 = ~My people are not dead.. at least... at least I do not think they are, but I know how it feels to lose your people also. I grieve with you, Chloe. I am sorry.~
@1179 = ~I... I need to rest. I need to clear my head. Can we please get to an inn? I can't go on this way.~
@1180 = ~We all have lost those dear to us.~
@1181 = ~Minsc understands as well. Dynaheir is lost to us as well. Would you like Boo to comfort you?~
@1182 = ~No! You do not understand! Have you ever lost hundreds of loved ones in a single night?! Were you away on some foolish quest while everyone you ever loved was slaughtered?! WERE YOU!?~
@1183 = ~No. But I have lost those I've loved very dearly, in front of my face, and I could do nothing to help. You're grieving, I am here for you.~
@1184 = ~I guess you're right. I can still offer you my sympathies though, and a shoulder to cry on. I've lost loved ones also, so I know a little of what you're going through, though I have not lost quite as many as you, and not as suddenly.~
@1185 = ~I understand if you feel you need to leave. I can carry on without you.~
@1186 = ~I... I'm sorry. I did not mean to belittle your loss. Please... I need to rest and think about this. Can we please go to an inn for the night?~
@1187 = ~<CHARNAME>... I need to rest, I can't go on like this... please...~ [NOSOUND]
@1188 = ~We are on the way, the Five Flagons inn is just around the corner, just hold on a little longer...~
@1189 = ~I need to do some other things first. We'll go to the inn as soon as possible.~
@1190 = ~I've changed my mind, we are not going to that inn. Get over it, girl.~
@1191 = ~Then we have nothing more to discuss. Farewell, you heartless bitch. Pray that we don't meet again.~
@1192 = ~No... I need to go *now*. And I'm going with or without you...~
@1193 = ~Very well, Chloe. We'll head to the inn right away.~
@1194 = ~The truth is that I've changed my mind and we are not going to that inn.~
@1195 = ~It's obvious we aren't going into an inn anytime soon. I've begged you to go, but apparently it means nothing to you...~ [NOSOUND]
@1196 = ~I warned you... farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@1197 = ~I never realized how cruel you have become, <CHARNAME>. I lost my soul too but I don't feel the need to toss the people I care about away like trash.~ [NOSOUND]
@1198 = ~I've got too much to worry about on my own without taking care of Chloe while she's having a crisis. I'm sorry, Imoen. I just can't deal with it.~
@1199 = ~I didn't like her anymore anyway. It was easier letting her down this way.~
@1200 = ~Quiet and get back in your place, brat.~
@1201 = ~I never realized how cruel you have become, <CHARNAME>. I lost my soul too but I didn't feel the need to toss the people I care about away like trash.~ [NOSOUND]
@1202 = ~I once said I'd never leave your side, <CHARNAME>. But you aren't the person I made that pledge to. Goodbye.~
@1203 = ~That is the most revolting thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth, <CHARNAME>. You've reached a new low.~
@1204 = ~It's that much effort to let her rest and grieve a while? Offer your shoulder to cry on? Wow... you really have changed. I hope I don't go through any more crises, because I don't think I can trust you to be there for me anymore.~
@1205 = ~I see you've woken up. I could not sleep overly much, myself. I kept seeing the faces of my villagers. (Sigh)~ [CHLOEL8]
@1206 = ~Would you like to talk about it?~
@1207 = ~Are you feeling any better? Perhaps I should have comforted you more last night...~
@1208 = ~Perhaps a joke or two will take your mind off of it?~
@1209 = ~Sorry to hear that.~
@1210 = ~I'm sorry to burden you with my problems. I expect comrades and friends to fall in battle. I even expect to lose a good number of them from time to time. But I never... ever expected to lose everyone I love in one single night in a battle over a boy!~
@1211 = ~How could a boy be so important that an army would raze an entire village to the ground and slaughter every living person in it to reach him? I believe I know what boy it was too... an Elfish boy. He was odd all his life. He always seemed more... aggressive than everyone else. More... bloodthirsty. Which, for a Yr'kai to say that means something.~
@1212 = ~I suppose it doesn't matter though. We'll worry about it after we take care of this mage and whatever plans he has for your soul. Let's go, then. I'm ready. I need to get my mind off my village.~
@1213 = ~I'm really not in the mood to hear a joke. It's sweet of you to offer though, <CHARNAME>. I've got too much on my mind. My village... everyone I know and love.~
@1214 = ~And this boy as well. Why would an army attack my village and destroy it all to capture a single boy? There was an Elfish boy, who always seemed different than everyone else. I would wager he was the one captured. But why?~
@1215 = ~No, I needed to be alone to think. You did the right thing. I suppose I'm alone for good now, though. I feel so... empty. My entire life has lost its meaning.~
@1216 = ~I understand. I felt much like that after losing Gorion. But I was being hunted by Sarevok's assassins, so I did not have time to stop and grieve.~
@1217 = ~You still have me, Chloe.~
@1218 = ~Would you like me to cheer you up? Tell a joke perhaps?~
@1219 = ~Oh... ok. Sorry.~
@1220 = ~(Sigh) I guess we can continue on then. I'm sorry to be such a bother.~
@1221 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. That means a lot to me. I have so little left now, it all seems almost meaningless.~
@1222 = ~I've been thinking though. Why would an army attack my village and destroy it all to capture a single boy? There was an Elfish boy, who always seemed different than everyone else. I would wager he was the one captured. But why?~
@1223 = ~I suppose I've asked you to stop long enough. I don't know how I will go on with my life, but I shall try my best, one day at a time.~
@1224 = ~No. But I should anyway. I've got nothing left in this world that I care about. I've... never felt this way in my entire life.~ [CHLOEL8B]
@1225 = ~<CHARNAME>, I will fight by your side, and if need be, die for you. I will not stay behind.~
@1226 = ~There is something I feel I must tell you though, before we rush into battle with Irenicus. If the deaths of my tribe has taught me anything, it is that life is too short.~
@1227 = ~I do not wish to die without telling you how I truly feel. I am in love with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1228 = ~I am so glad to hear that, Chloe. I love you, as well (Kiss Chloe tenderly). All right then, let's get going and finish off Irenicus. My soul awaits, and our lives together do as well.~
@1229 = ~Chloe, I must admit that I am only fond of you. I did not realize your feelings ran so deeply. I hope that our friendship will continue, though. I do not wish to lose you.~
@1230 = ~Chloe, I was really only interested in you for the chance to make love with you, if you want to know the truth. You haven't exactly obliged my desires yet, and now you profess love? I want nothing of it. I'm sorry.~
@1231 = ~I see. How crude. Perhaps I only saw what I wanted to see in you, my apologies. Let us go then, I need a distraction from my breaking heart.~
@1232 = ~I see. I cannot blame you, <CHARNAME>. It is not your fault that you don't feel the same way about me that I do of you. I will try to get past my feelings. Let us continue on then, I need a distraction.~
@1233 = ~Let's go then... my love.~
@1234 = ~<CHARNAME>, though I'm loathed to admit it, I have a softspot in my heart for you. I can't let you rush foolishly into battle without me being there to keep your fool self alive, right? Now, let's get going.~
@1235 = ~Well, I'm sorry <CHARNAME>, but I would be a fool to lay my life down for you. My attempts at friendship were tossed aside, so I feel no compulsion to die for you. Good luck, regardless.~
@1236 = ~Err...~ [NOSOUND]
@1237 = ~*Ahem!*~
@1238 = ~Chloe, the Yr'kai warrior who joined you to help rescue Imoen. Recently, she and your sister have been enjoying a romance together. You know she feels deeply for Imoen, but this is not her fight. Perhaps she should stay behind?~
@1239 = ~Chloe, you joined to help rescue Imoen, and that goal is accomplished. This is not your fight, and perhaps you should stay behind? I can't ask you to continue on.~
@1240 = ~Chloe, I know you care for Imoen, so perhaps it is best if you remain behind? I know she would not want you to die, and we may likely do just that.~
@1241 = ~Are you up for this, Chloe? You won't back out on me and Imoen, will you?~
@1242 = ~Chloe, the Yr'kai warrior who joined you to help rescue Imoen. Recently your relationship with her has blossomed into romance. She is now the last of her tribe, however, and perhaps you do not wish to risk her life. Perhaps she should stay behind?~
@1243 = ~Chloe, I care for you very much, but you are the last of your tribe now. We all might die in the coming battle and I cannot bear the thought of your death, so perhaps you should stay behind.~
@1244 = ~Chloe, you mean a great deal to me. I do not want anything bad to happen to you, so perhaps you should stay behind.~
@1245 = ~Well, this is it Chloe. You won't back out on me, will you?~
@1246 = ~Chloe, the Yr'kai warrior who joined you to help rescue Imoen. She remains by your side even after those goals were accomplished, but you wonder if she should stay behind now.~
@1247 = ~Chloe, everything you joined this party to accomplish is behind us. We all might die in the coming battle, and there is no need for you to risk your life further. Are you sure you with to remain?~
@1248 = ~Chloe, this is not your battle. If you wish to remain behind, I'll think no less of you.~
@1249 = ~Well, this is it, Chloe. You won't back out on me now, will you?~
@1250 = ~I will not stay behind, <CHARNAME>. I love Imoen, and I'd rather die than see her go into battle without me there to protect her. Imoen will follow you, and I will follow her.~
@1251 = ~You... you love me, Chloe? I'm so happy to hear that, I love you as well. I was unsure if you felt the same.~
@1252 = ~I love you with all my heart and soul, my dearest nightingale. Even if it costs me my life, I will fight by your side.~
@1253 = ~Let's get going then, and make sure you bring some wine to celebrate over that bastard's corpse. Maybe some sweets to roast on the bonfire we'll make of it as well? (Grin)~
@1254 = ~Ah... this is great. An all female party doing great things and on a noble quest. Does it get any better?~ [NOSOUND]
@1255 = ~Somehow I think that is a loaded question, Chloe.~
@1256 = ~I... I don't think I understand. What do you mean, Nalia?~
@1257 = ~I believe she means that perhaps Chloe is having lusty thoughts about us all, is that not so, Nalia?~
@1258 = ~Do not be so crude, Drow. Chloe meant nothing of the sort.~
@1259 = ~Actually... now that you mention it... how friendly are we? Seriously...~
@1260 = ~I like you a lot, Chloe. You're a lot n-nicer than you let on.~
@1261 = ~Aerie... she means...~
@1262 = ~The thought is not entirely displeasing. Well, let me rephrase, I do not want the eyes of Sister Light or the Frowning Druid to rest upon me, let alone their hands...~
@1263 = ~W-what? What are you talking about, you vile...~
@1264 = ~Pay her no mind, Aerie. She is once again trying to stir up trouble.~
@1265 = ~There sure is a lot of tension in this group. Perhaps it *would* help if we all...~
@1266 = ~If we all what?! Am I the only one who has no idea what is going on here?!~
@1267 = ~I'm lost too, Aerie.~
@1268 = ~Would you all be quiet and get moving again please?~
@1269 = ~Won't someone explain it to me then?~
@1270 = ~Certainly, Sister Light. It'll all start with you removing your robe...~
@1271 = ~Viconia! Please, I think we should spare Aerie our filthy ideas of group activities.~
@1272 = ~Enough of this. We have more important things to do than to indulge in Chloe's and Viconia's wanton lusts.~
@1273 = ~You mean... you were talking about... all of us... together... wow.~
@1274 = ~Aerie, you're lagging behind. Come on, my dear.~
@1275 = ~Oh, what fun. Aerie, walk with me a while. I think you might have questions...~
@1276 = ~Do not sully her mind, child. Quiet down and resume walking.~
@1277 = ~When are we going to get some horses, by the way? My feet are aching.~
@1278 = ~Oh, you're no fun, <CHARNAME>. Can't you let us have a little girltalk for once? Ah well.~
@1279 = ~And you remember Chloe, right? I don't know how she got in here, but Irenicus... he did something to her too. Stole her soul too, but it broke out. Took him days to fix it...~
@1280 = ~Pretty colors... my head feels alone... are you my mommy? Why is it so dark...~
@1281 = ~I hate to see her like this... *Sigh*~
@1282 = ~Why... pain in chest... where did everyone go? Shadows everywhere... Music? Pretty music...~
@1283 = ~Imoen... Imoen... is that you? Run... get away from here... don't let... wizard... get you...~
@1284 = ~He... he already got me, Chloe. But, we're gunna get him back. Can you walk?~
@1285 = ~So dark... so very dark...~
@1286 = ~CHLOE!~
@1287 = ~Imoen? So glad... you're safe. <CHARNAME>... take care of her. Get back... what was stolen. I... ugh.~
@1288 = ~... She's gone. Is... is that what's going to happen to us if we don't get our souls back, <CHARNAME>? *Shudders and blinks away a tear.* Let's go, we'll mourn her later.~
@1289 = ~You must be joking. I will not even consider leaving your group until you give my weapon back, <CHARNAME>.~ [NOSOUND]
@1290 = ~You... you wish me to leave? This is unexpected. I will not be tossed away like an empty ration tin! Please reconsider.~ [NOSOUND]
@1291 = ~I misspoke, my apologies. Please, stay in the group, Chloe.~
@1292 = ~It is not personal, Chloe. I just do not need your services right now. Perhaps we will need them again later.~
@1293 = ~You vile h'achteiliss! I will leave then. Do not expect things to be the same if you seek me out again. I am a mercenary, and next time you will meet me as such. I will be at the Den of the Seven Vales should you need my services again. Bring lots of money, <CHARNAME>.~
@1294 = ~It is no problem. The heat can sometimes make one confused and friends may seem less necessary. Let us get back to our travels then.~
@1295 = ~Hello again. Ah... Imoen. It's good to see you again, how are you?~
@1296 = ~All right. I probably would have charged you for my services but I will let you slide this time, simply because Imoen has a pretty smile. Let us be off then.~
@1297 = ~Hello again. Was there something you wanted?~ [NOSOUND]
@1298 = ~I would like you to join us, if you would? I could use your fighting skills.~
@1299 = ~No, just saying hello.~
@1300 = ~Ok, I'll order another elven wine then.~
@1301 = ~You don't inspire my generosity.~
@1302 = ~And you were very rude with me before, <CHARNAME>. I did not appreciate that in the least.~
@1303 = ~So, if you want my services in your party, you'll have to pay me. For the job you are undertaking, I think 10,000 gold is fair. Take it or leave it, it's not negotiable.~
@1304 = ~All right. I'll pay. Your fighting skills are worth the cost.~
@1305 = ~I don't have that much right now. I'll come back when I have more money. Farewell.~
@1306 = ~That's an outrageous sum! I'll not pay. Won't you join out of the kindness of your heart?~
@1307 = ~Nice doing business with you. Let's go, then.~
@1308 = ~Well... fine. But only because I want to help rescue Imoen. You're lucky, I'm feeling generous today.~
@1309 = ~I just told you, it's not negotiable. Either pay, or go on about your business.~
@1310 = ~Forget about it! I'll just kill you!!~
@1311 = ~Heya Chloe. I'm doing better. Hey, <CHARNAME>, we got room for Chloe in the party?~
@1312 = ~Yes. Chloe, if you wish to join us I would be happy to have you.~
@1313 = ~Not at this moment. Perhaps later.~
@1314 = ~What do you want, kah'suth?~
@1315 = ~Chloe... I know you're angry with me. I apologize.~
@1316 = ~What's your problem, Chloe?~
@1317 = ~You look strange.~
@1318 = ~ Nevermind.~
@1319 = ~And that is supposed to make it all better? Hmm... well, you seem genuinely regretful, so I'll forgive you this time. I guess everyone can be a jerk at times.~
@1320 = ~You, jar'crith.~
@1321 = ~(Throws you a withering glare)~
@1322 = ~Yes?~ [NOSOUND]
@1323 = ~(Smile at Chloe)~
@1324 = ~(Bend over to adjust your boot, being sure your posterior is pointed towards Chloe)~
@1325 = ~Chloe, your fighting style is simply amazing. (Smile)~
@1326 = ~(Wink at Chloe)~
@1327 = ~(Smile shyly at Chloe and blush)~
@1328 = ~Chloe... your beauty takes my breath away~
@1329 = ~(Give Chloe a quick kiss on the cheek)~
@1330 = ~(Give Chloe a passionate kiss)~
@1331 = ~(Play with Chloe's hair)~
@1332 = ~You have lovely eyes, Chloe.~
@1333 = ~I'm so glad you're on my side, Chloe. You are on... *my* side, if you know what I mean, right? (Devilish grin)~
@1334 = ~How did you come to find out that Akadia was your mother?~
@1335 = ~How do you feel about being a demigod?~
@1336 = ~Have you much knowledge of this region of Faerun?~
@1337 = ~What is your favorite color?~
@1338 = ~I'd like to hear about one of your past adventures, Chloe.~
@1339 = ~Is there anyone you'd really like to test your skills against, Chloe?~
@1340 = ~What do you know about your father?~
@1341 = ~Chloe, do you plan on being an adventurer forever, or do you see a time in the future when you can leave that behind you? Not necessarily give up training, mind you, maybe start an acadaemy or something...~
@1342 = ~Tell me more about Celeste of Waterdeep.~
@1343 = ~So how did you come to realize that you preferred a woman's company?~
@1344 = ~Can you remember any more of Celeste of Waterdeep's poems, Chloe?~
@1345 = ~What was your first girlfriend's name?~
@1346 = ~A copper for your thoughts...~
@1347 = ~Could you remind me of something I asked you before?~
@1348 = ~Whoa, are you alright? You look all... strange...~
@1349 = ~Nevermind.~
@1350 = ~Sure...~
@1351 = ~So you noticed it too, hmm? I'll have to do something about it...~
@1352 = ~My tribe told me not too long after I learned how to talk. It was confirmed when she came to me after my Thl'mirlas, of course.~
@1353 = ~About the same I feel about having red hair, or being Yr'kai. It is a part of me and what I am, but has little impact on my life.~
@1354 = ~What, Amn in general? Probably not too much more than yourself, I've only been here for a little over a year. I'd know much more about regions north of the Sword Coast, I'm afraid.~
@1355 = ~I'd have to say red. The color of passion, love, and blood.~
@1356 = ~Ah... let me think. There was one time that I met this elf girl on the road. She walked with me a while and would run around me quickly and claim she was so much faster than myself.~
@1357 = ~I got quite sick of it after a while though, and challenged her. She refused to fight, but said some practice sword maneuvers would serve just as well to show who was faster. I agreed.~
@1358 = ~She went first, and I must admit she was frightfully quick. But, I believed myself faster, so I went next. While I was performing my maneuvers, she ran up, lifted my coinpurse, and ran off.~
@1359 = ~I pursued her, but she had disappeared, and I was copperless. She taught me a valuable lesson. No matter how good you are, there's always someone better. And they might just prove it to you by taking your coinpurse and running off.~
@1360 = ~I was actually hoping for a more... heroic story, Chloe.~
@1361 = ~I see your point, Chloe. Thank you.~
@1362 = ~I never claimed to be a hero, <CHARNAME>. Leave those stories to the others, or the braggarts at the inns.~
@1363 = ~There are several renowned warriors I've heard of that I would want to spar or battle, certainly. If I ever meet my father, I would probably want to test my skills against him. There aren't many specific names I could rattle off at the moment though, I'm not even sure how many of these warriors still yet live, after all.~
@1364 = ~To tell you the truth, only his name. Masemeron. My tribe told me he was a great warrior not of our people, but no one else seems to have heard of him. A pity.~
@1365 = ~I suppose I might settle down with the right person someday. But I would want to train people as well as help protect the area I settle in. If I must die one day though, I want to die in battle. I haven't reached the point yet where I look forward to settling down, however.~
@1366 = ~She was a poet from about three centuries ago, most known for her poems of love to other women, or poems praising the beauty and grace of females. I know little of her life outside of her poetry, but few people do.~
@1367 = ~I like reading her poetry because it's good and it's on a subject I rather like. Perhaps if you cook dinner tonight I'll let you borrow my book of her poetry? (Grin)~
@1368 = ~The same way I came to realize that I prefer salt on my potatoes. I thought it looked good so I tried it, and I liked it. It wasn't any big startling revelation. Sorry to disappoint you.~
@1369 = ~Yes, several off the top of my head. Let's see...~
@1370 = ~'My eyes burn, my hand trembles.~
@1371 = ~My heart yearns, my lips quiver.~
@1372 = ~My skin still tingles where you last touched,~
@1373 = ~My pillow still bears your lovely scent.~
@1374 = ~I reach out for you, only to meet air.~
@1375 = ~Return to me soon, my darling.~
@1376 = ~I am nothing without you.~
@1377 = ~The stars no longer fill me with wonder,~
@1378 = ~And my mind wanders,~
@1379 = ~But my pillow still bears your lovely scent.'~
@1380 = ~Feel free to read some the next time we make camp, <CHARNAME>.~
@1381 = ~My first girlfriend? Theresa. She was very passionate and headstrong, but the relationship burnt out rather quickly. A shame, she was rather lovely.~
@1382 = ~Only a copper? Well, all right. I'm thinking that if a larger opponent is using a pike like weapon, the best attack is a low roll and a slice across the hamstrings. If that doesn't work, one blade to lock the weapon and the other to stab works well.~
@1383 = ~Of course, then there is what to do against an invisible opponent. One cannot always rely on senses because some opponents are masters of stealthy movement. A number of quick slices and stabs in the area around you may be the only option.~
@1384 = ~I was also thinking that in the next battle I might try out this maneuver I heard about where you stab if you're losing your balance backwards. I've only been able to practice against air, after all.~
@1385 = ~And don't you think that the tavern wench in that last inn was cute? I think she was giving me the eye. Too bad we didn't stay longer.~
@1386 = ~I guess I won't bore you with my other thoughts at that particular moment. You are already looking around for someone else to talk to. Ah well.~
@1387 = ~Well, someone is feeling happy today. (Grin)~
@1388 = ~(Gives your posterior a sudden loud swat and chuckles at you) Sorry, it was just too tempting!~
@1389 = ~Of course. Though, given the chance I could show you a few of my other skills as well. (Grin)~
@1390 = ~(Blows a kiss at you and wags her eyebrows suggestively)~
@1391 = ~Aw, you're so cute, <CHARNAME>! Wait till I pinch your bum before you blush like that though. Woohoo!~
@1392 = ~Why thank you, <CHARNAME>. But you're still not getting my cookies.~
@1393 = ~(Grins then grabs you to make it a deep, passionate kiss)~
@1394 = ~Thought you'd get away with that, did you?~
@1395 = ~Oooh baby, kiss me again!~
@1396 = ~Ooo, if I could purr I sure would now. Mmmmm.~
@1397 = ~Not half as lovely as what they are peering at, however. (Grin)~
@1398 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. I could be in a few other places too, given the opportunity. (Evil smile)~
@1399 = ~And that's all? "Farewell, Imoen, I no longer need you"? Imoen didn't deserve that and you know it, <CHARNAME>. I didn't expect something like this from you. I find it truly... disappointing.~ [NOSOUND]
@1400 = ~You have lost the little respect you had earned from me.~
@1401 = ~So you throw her away like trash, don't you? After going through so much trouble to rescue her... and now you dispose of her when you don't need her anymore. Well, I can't say I didn't expect something like this from you.~ [NOSOUND]
@1402 = ~Without Imoen around I feel like I have no reason to be here anymore. Farewell, <CHARNAME>. With a bit of luck I can catch up with her and convince her NOT to wait for you, in that tavern or anywhere in the realms for that matter.~
@1403 = ~That murdering grae'kae'ith! He played us like fools. <CHARNAME>, you are planning on rescuing your sister and slaughtering that jar'crith, are you not?! I'll even forgo my fee and remain in your party... for now. Imoen has been through too much already.~
@1404 = ~Take young Chloe here. I understand you two have grown rather... fond of each other of late. How quaint. But it's so hard on young couples when something happens to one of them, don't you agree?~
@1405 = ~Certainly. Jon-boy is going to miss his sister terribly. Boo hoo. But no matter, he'll be joining you in death shortly.~
@1406 = ~Oh, you misunderstand, you simple-minded barbarian. It is you who shall be missed. Come to me, my pet...~
@1407 = ~Argh... get *out* of my head, gor'hlahk!~
@1408 = ~Chloe... are you alright?~
@1409 = ~You... have never faced... a Yr'kai warrior... have you? I have too much pride to be controlled by a jar'crith like you! My people train to resist such dominations as that. (Sigh) Care to try again?~
@1410 = ~Impossible! Filthy barbarian slime! Fine then...~
@1411 = ~<CHARNAME>? You look a bit ill. Are you cold? What... what is that look in your eyes?~
@1412 = ~Chloe, please stand away from me! I don't know if I can protect you...~
@1413 = ~Back off, Chloe. I'm not feeling like myself, and I fear something terrible is about to happen...~
@1414 = ~Get away from me, woman! Can't you see something terrible is happening to me!? Run!~
@1415 = ~<CHARNAME>? I didn't quite catch that. Your lips are moving but no sound is coming. Wait... NO! <CHARNAME>!~
@1416 = ~By the gods, <CHARNAME>! You nearly tore me to shreds!~
@1417 = ~It would pain me to do so... but if you lose control like that again, we might have to... No, let us not think of it. Lead on, we must escape from this place quickly and regain what you have lost.~
