@71   = ~Chloe grew up near Neverwinter in a small orphanage. She claims to be the bastard offspring of Akadia --goddess of air and speed of movement-- and a mortal man. Though she has no proof of her heritage, her supernatural speed and skill certainly give it some credibility. Chloe is driven by some inner urge to improve her skills constantly, spending hours a day practicing whenever she can. You wonder how she manages to fight so well when most would be fatigued from this constant practice, but she simply gives you a friendly smile and says it's simply due to daily practice and not to her divine heritage. She feels a certain kinship to you and Imoen, due to your similar divine parentage.~
