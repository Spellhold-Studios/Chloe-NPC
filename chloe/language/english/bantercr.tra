@0    = ~Imoen, isn't it?~
@1    = ~Yes. Something on your mind, Chloe?~
@2    = ~To say that your eyes look haunted would be an understatement.~
@3    = ~Yes, well I am a bit distracted. We have to get out of this dungeon as quickly as possible... before... the shadows... Ow, my head...~
@4    = ~I have seen much in my life, but rarely have I seen such cruelty upon one so innocent...~
@5    = ~Innocent? I don't think I've been accused of innocence since... well... possibly ever. Were this any other day, I'd have likely picked your pocket by now, and possibly framed <CHARNAME> for it.~
@6    = ~But today?~
@7    = ~... I just want to get out of this place while my sanity is intact. I'll pick your pocket another day, I promise. (Weak smile)~
@8    = ~I am... sorry you have been through such an ordeal. But I shall hold you to your promise.~
@9    = ~You don't strike me as the type to normally care what kind of ordeal anyone else has been through... no offense meant.~
@10   = ~None taken, because you are correct. And I don't... care...~
@11   = ~Hmm?~
@12   = ~I... enough of this. Let us make haste out of this dark dungeon, while we are still young.~
@13   = ~Aww... so sweet of you to care, Chloe.~
@14   = ~... Must I carry you out upon my shoulder?~
@15   = ~Any other day, I'd take you up on that. But you are right, let us get out of here. The shadows are making me nervous again...~
@16   = ~You're cute, Imoen.~
@17   = ~Um... thank you.~
@18   = ~I can see the family resemblance between you and <CHARNAME>.~
@19   = ~Really? No one has ever mistaken us for biological sisters before.~
@20   = ~Oh, it's subtle. In the eyes. In the bearing. You share a lot of <CHARNAME>'s most attractive qualities.~
@21   = ~Are you hitting on me, Chloe? Because, though I'm flattered and think you're pretty sexy as well, I don't think <CHARNAME> would appreciate her girl hitting on her sister.~
@22   = ~Hahaha. No, I'm definitely <CHARNAME>'s girl. I was just complimenting you. In a way, you're kind of my sister now as well.~
@23   = ~Yeah... yeah you're right. That's kinda cool. Family group hug? Teehee!~
@24   = ~Given what <CHARNAME> has told me about you, Immy, you're likely to lift my purse during the hug. I'll pass for now.~
@25   = ~Aw... does this mean you want your ring back too?~
@26   = ~Why you! Come here, girl!~
@27   = ~(Giggles and returns the ring before any damage can be done)~
@28   = ~I've noticed you looking at the stars quite a bit, Immy.~
@29   = ~Yeah... I miss home. It's funny, I spent most of my childhood there wishing I was anywhere else, but I made the most of it. I made my own fun with <CHARNAME>, often at Gorion's or Winthrop's expense. But now I yearn for the simpler days, before I found out I was a Bhaalspawn.~
@30   = ~I've often wondered what my life would be like had I not found out about my own divine heritage.~
@31   = ~How *did* you find out, anyway? Did a whirling cloud of air appear before you and say "Come to mama?" (grin)~
@32   = ~Haha... no, nothing so dramatic. A tribe in the north, the Yr'kai, traveled all the way down to Neverwinter to the orphanage where I had been left and adopted me. They are devout followerers of Akadia, and it was she who told them who I was and asked them to raise me as one of their own.~
@33   = ~But they might have had the wrong person. Or they might have been crazy. Did you ever find out for sure?~
@34   = ~When I passed the Thl'mirlas, the Rite of Passage, basically making me an adult in the tribe, I was visited by the avatar of Akadia and given this scimitar to show her divine favor and pride in my accomplishments.~
@35   = ~The Yr'kai... they founded the way of the Kensai, did they not?~
@36   = ~Yes. Every man, woman, and child learns the way of the Kensai in the Yr'kai.~
@37   = ~Wow. And how did you gain Lathander's favor?~
@38   = ~I slept with his high priestess.~
@39   = ~WHAT?!~
@40   = ~Haha. Only joking. The Yr'kai pay homage to both Akadia and Lathandar. Lathandar bestowed this short sword to me upon my 17th winter. I had already become the greatest torque in my tribe. Torque is like master, and also teacher.~
@41   = ~Wow. And you slept with the high priestess.~
@42   = ~Of course. (grin) I'll tell you all about it tonight at camp.~
@43   = ~(giggle)~
@44   = ~How do you think your Bhaal essence plays into you and <CHARNAME> being siblings?~
@45   = ~What, you mean like blood relations?~
@46   = ~Yes.~
@47   = ~Well... I don't think it works quite like as if we had the same father. But I'm not sure. I think our shared blood is at a minimum. It's impossible to say, I suppose. Why do you ask?~
@48   = ~Oh, well I've often wondered if Akadia has any other children out there. And if I met them, would they be like a sibling, or just another person?~
@49   = ~Did you have any foster brothers or sisters?~
@50   = ~Yes and no. The Yr'kai raise their children as a community. Babies are placed all together and raised by the entire tribe. You can't even tell who your children are, for sure. You can sometimes guess, I suppose. So, in a way, all Yr'kai are my brothers and sisters, but in the sense you mean, no.~
@51   = ~So you've never known what it was like to have a true sibling. I suppose since I've always thought of <CHARNAME> as one, it doesn't throw me that much about the Bhaal connection.~
@52   = ~Which leads me to wonder about any other children of Akadia, and if they exist.~
@53   = ~You know what I think?~
@54   = ~What's that?~
@55   = ~I think it's strange that you didn't notice that I lifted your coinpurse three days ago.~
@56   = ~What?! By the gods girl, you have control issues! Give me back my coinpurse!~
@57   = ~You have to catch me first! Hahahaha!~
@58   = ~Hey wait... where'd you go? That's not fair! <CHARNAME>, tell your sister to give me back my coinpurse! Aaah!~
@59   = ~You seem cross with me, Jaheira. Have I done something to offend you?~
@60   = ~I have not the time for your floundering about for reassurance, child. You've done nothing yet to earn my ire, so leave me be if you plan it to remain thus.~
@61   = ~Hmm, someone woke up on the wrong side of the campfire today.~
@62   = ~Do not speak of things you do not understand! I will hear none of it!~
@63   = ~So who was this Khalid guy that you've been having nightmares about?~
@64   = ~You will be warned once and once only to never sully his name by speaking it ever again.~
@65   = ~Ouch. You have a right to be angry with him, though.~
@66   = ~I warned you once...~
@67   = ~It's also ok to ask us to stop for a while and let you grieve.~
@68   = ~Why would you care?~
@69   = ~As long as you're looking down at the earth, you're not watching for ambushes. Any care beyond that is my own business. It is enough.~
@70   = ~I will speak no more on this subject. Continue walking, Chloe.~
@71   = ~The queen has spoken. Sally forth, peasants! (grin)~
@72   = ~You're giving me that look again.~
@73   = ~And what look are you referring to, godling?~
@74   = ~That Harper look, judging whether I'm going to suddenly throw the Balance out of whack by just scratching my nose.~
@75   = ~I am doing nothing of the sort!~
@76   = ~I beg to differ, m'lady.~
@77   = ~I'll have you know I was thinking that I am glad you fight on our side, and nothing about your disruption of the balance by your nose-picking!~
@78   = ~So you're sure I'm on your side?~
@79   = ~Though I am sure of little else about you, yes I trust that you are on our side, at least for now.~
@80   = ~I am honored by your trust. May I ask, however, what your side is that I seem to be on?~
@81   = ~Why, the side of balance, and of righteousness, of course.~
@82   = ~Right... I could care less about balancing forces I don't believe in. And I tend to think that order and chaos balance themselves rather well on their own. As far as being in the right, that's a matter of opinion.~
@83   = ~Regardless, I think we're leaving the world a better place for now, and that's always good. Beyond that, I'll not commit to claiming to maintain some illustrious balance.~
@84   = ~Whether you believe in the balance or fight for the balance, you still help maintain it, and that is enough. But no more speaking, we have quests to get back to.~
@85   = ~You know what I really hate about all this Harper balance nonsense?~
@86   = ~Other than your own ignorance concerning Harper business, I haven't a clue.~
@87   = ~You come to some town that's beset by a tribe of gnolls. You join the forces of the town until the gnolls are weak and nearly dead.~
@88   = ~*Then* you give the gnolls supplies and/or fight on *their* side. Pretty soon, the townspeople *and* the gnolls hate your guts and want you dead.~
@89   = ~But the balance between the two is maintained. You have a point to all this rambling, I assume?~
@90   = ~Yes, oh cranky one, I do. Once everyone hates you, all you have is enemies. Your chances of surviving for longer than a short while are now next to nothing.~
@91   = ~Adventuring is dangerous business. Being a mercenary, as you were not too long ago, perhaps even more so. Your entire tribe's society is based on warfare.~
@92   = ~In fact, you all nearly had yourselves wiped out by your over-aggressiveness. And yet you survive, and the balance is maintained.~
@93   = ~My tribe made a nearly fatal mistake by not making alliances. Were we not bound by treaties, we would not make the same mistake were we free to do as we would now.~
@94   = ~We learn from our mistakes. The Harpers have not. And by the way, I am a bit offended by your flippantly regarding the holocaust of my people as part of the balance.~
@95   = ~Your people's savagery was put in check by society. That *is* the balance, child. The sooner you accept this the sooner you can move on with your life. This discussion is over for now.~
@96   = ~You really annoy me, Jaheira.~
@97   = ~I am neither surprised nor interested. Return to the task at hand.~
@98   = ~I have known <CHARNAME> for a very long time now and yet still she surprises me.~
@99   = ~How so, Aunty Jaheira?~
@100  = ~Do not call me by that name, child. As I was saying, though I noticed her gaze occasionally stray towards women, I never knew she was interested enough to make a relationship out of it.~
@101  = ~Hmm. Does it bother you?~
@102  = ~Not at all. I merely am surprised by it. I tend to forget how quickly <CHARNAME> is growing up. I had not thought her ready for a serious relationship, is all.~
@103  = ~Hmm. Well, I assure you she's matured quite nicely.~
@104  = ~Save your crude comments for one who has ears for such. Though I am happy for <CHARNAME> I feel I must give you a warning. <CHARNAME> has been through a lot as of late. Be mindful of her feelings. Do not abuse her trust.~
@105  = ~Jaheira, I don't need you to tell me how to treat...~
@106  = ~Save your anger for our enemies. I know you will try to take care of <CHARNAME>, and I give you my blessing. I pray to Silvanus that you will both be happy.~
@107  = ~Hmm. Thank you, Aunty Jaheira, that means a lot. I'm going to catch up to her now. (Hurries away from Jaheira, snickering)~
@108  = ~Blast it girl, stop *calling* me that!~
@109  = ~Minsc, where is Boo right now?~
@110  = ~Boo is here in my pack where he belongs. Right, Boo?~
@111  = ~Good, so this hamster that's stealing crackers from my pack is another rodent and I can snap it's neck and toss it onto the grass.~
@112  = ~Eh, I would be most displeased if hamsters were slain in my presence. Reserve your righteous fury for evil's backside, Chloe!~
@113  = ~Any rodent who deems my rations as food is evil to me. Prepare to die, evil hamster!~
@114  = ~No! Boo! NOOO!!!!!~
@115  = ~Ah HAH! So it WAS Boo!~
@116  = ~(sobbing) Boo, oh Boo! How could you stray to the side of evil?! Oh, why Boo!? WHY?! ARGH!~
@117  = ~Minsc. Take your damned rodent before I really do slay him. And keep him out of my packs!~
@118  = ~Oh, joyous day! Boo yet lives! Naughty Boo! Minsc will have to teach you a lesson! No eyes for you for a while!~
@119  = ~Is that really a punishment? Never mind, I find myself really not wanting to know.~
@120  = ~Minsc and Chloe, what a team! Beware evil, our swords come for your wicked throats!~
@121  = ~Um... right. Woe to you evil. Whatever you are.~
@122  = ~Minsc and Chloe make a good team. Don't you agree?~
@123  = ~I suppose. You're not too bad in a fight. You could use a little extra practice, but you get the job done.~
@124  = ~Minsc is thinking Chloe is very pretty.~
@125  = ~Um... thank you. I'm flattered. I think.~
@126  = ~Minsc has noticed no men at your side, and he would be happy to stand there! Woe to you evil!~
@127  = ~Um... Minsc? I'm gay.~
@128  = ~Yes, Minsc is quite happy also. And evil is quaking in it's boots!~
@129  = ~No... I'm a lesbian.~
@130  = ~And I am a Rashemon!~
@131  = ~No... you don't understand. I only like other women in that way.~
@132  = ~Minsc doesn't understand. Boo is trying to explain it to me, but it makes no sense. How do you...~
@133  = ~Do you *really* want to know?~
@134  = ~... Boo is assuring me I do not. Minsc doesn't understand, but Minsc will accept it. Woe to you evil! Chloe is happy and likes women too!~
@135  = ~(sigh)~
@136  = ~Is there some reason why you're looking at me like that, Edwin? I didn't realize that there was an ancient arcane scroll strapped to my chest.~
@137  = ~I would have you know, dear girl, that this Thayvian male has left many a concubine gasping under his passionate onslaught. (As I'm sure the tales of my exploits has reached even your peasantgirl ears.)~
@138  = ~How nice for you. Did you have a point, Edwin, or were you just feeling insecure by my lack of fawning gazes cast your way?~
@139  = ~I thought, perhaps, that you might prefer the ecstasy of my manly passion to the tender unsure caresses of some simple peasant girl. (Though I doubt your weak mind could tell the difference.)~
@140  = ~Edwin, I've met many a woman whose "tender caresses" were far from unsure. Rather they were quite skilled and many knew places to touch me that drove me beyond passion, as only another woman can. The things one woman knows about another's body is knowledge you would kill for, Thayvian. But you shall never have.~
@141  = ~Whether you're interested in being bedded by one as skilled and passionate as I or sticking to your meek peasant girls, I'll not have you insulting my prowess! Perhaps my unparalleled magic would cow you, wench! (Yes, as well it should, blasted ingrate.)~
@142  = ~I'm sorry, Edwin. I didn't intend to insult your "manly prowess."~
@143  = ~Apology accepted. It is not your fault you're so inferior to me. (Everyone is inferior to me, of course. Nothing to be ashamed of.)~
@144  = ~You misunderstand. My intent was to insult *you*.~
@145  = ~Blasted girl! We shall settle this another day! (Yes, when your hand isn't on your sword. I've seen how fast you draw those blasted things. I'll have a flame arrow with your name on it.)~
@146  = ~Any time, mageling. I relish the challenge.~
@147  = ~I've seen drunk monkeys in the gladiator pits swing a sword with more care than you, blasted wench! You nearly took my head off in that last battle!~
@148  = ~First, it's not my fault that you were in my way. Second, it's not like <CHARNAME> would miss you, and I certainly know I wouldn't. Last, perhaps I was hoping you'd stumble into my sword so I wouldn't have to listen to your asinine comments anymore.~
@149  = ~Damn you girl! I'll strike you down here and now myself! (I hope these other simians stay out of it. This girl scares me half to death by herself as it stands...)~
@150  = ~Your head will roll on the ground before you get more than a word out of your incantation. Care to try your luck?~
@151  = ~Calm down you two! We have enough problems with our enemies without fighting amongst ourselves. Set your differences aside for now, alright?~
@152  = ~Alright! I've been wanting to see this showdown for quite a while now! Don't let me stop you!~
@153  = ~Die, you scab-festered goblin's child!~
@154  = ~Eat flame arrow, wench! (Oh by the nine hells, she's already drawn her swords!)~
@155  = ~Fine, <CHARNAME>. If the mage so much as casts a scowl my direction from now on though, I'll cut him down where he stands.~
@156  = ~Yes, agreed. (Though as soon as you and I are alone, I'll surprise you and slay you. The others will think you were ambushed. Hahaha Simple fools).~
@157  = ~Hey, where'd they go?! Bah! Don't leave me behind!~
@158  = ~Barely broke a sweat. Shall we continue on, then?~
@159  = ~Of course. Thank you for killing that arrogant bastard, by the way.~
@160  = ~Damn it girl, you could have just scared him a little. Now I'm without a good mage. Get out of here, you're too violent to be trustworthy.~
@161  = ~He got what he deserved. Farewell, then. Be sure you won't see me again.~
@162  = ~He got what he deserved.~
@163  = ~Aha! That's what you get for combating a Thayvian red wizard, fool! Especially the great Edwin Odessieron!~
@164  = ~<CHARNAME!> I trust that my superior magic skills have proven themselves once again. Now let us continue. (And woe to any of you other simian fools who dare try to best me in combat! Bahahaha!)~
@165  = ~Right you are, Edwin. You blasted that arrogant wench into next week! Welcome back.~
@166  = ~Blasted mage! You could have just cast a sleep spell on her and painted her face up in an embarrassing fashion! Now I'm without a good fighter! Get out of here, you make me sick, wizard.~
@167  = ~The whore got what she was asking for. No one challenges Edwin Odesseiron and survives.~
@168  = ~Bah! You are no better than that insolent whore, you pathetic monkey. Rot in your mediocrity if that is what you desire.~
@169  = ~I must say, Edwina, you look much more ravishing as a female.~
@170  = ~Turn your hated gaze elsewhere, woman! I'll not have you eyeing me up now that I'm cursed with womanhood! (Though I must admit I do look rather attractive.)~
@171  = ~Oh, don't worry. More pleasing on the eye you may be, but you're still as ugly as an ogre's backside when you open your mouth. Besides, even if I find you more attractive now, I still know that deep down you're a horrid looking brute of a man.~
@172  = ~What, even with this female form, you still won't bed me?! Damned transformation, I thought it may be good for at least one thing! Bah!! (Though if I'm desperate that Salvanas fellow should be easy. Ack! What am I thinking! I must remove this accursed spell with haste!)~
@173  = ~Viconia, I must say I find you to be very beautiful and sensual.~
@174  = ~So, rivvil, you find my dark skin and curvaceous body to be alluring, is that so?~
@175  = ~Certainly. You're an exotic and attractive woman.~
@176  = ~And what is your intent in telling me this? Are you interested in the dark passions of a drow? Do you think you could handle the ferocity and talents of Viconia De'Vir?~
@177  = ~I could, and I feel I could offer up a few talents of my own. So, is that an offer, lovely drow?~
@178  = ~It most certainly is not. You are not worthy of my exotic arts, woman. Turn your lustful eyes upon someone else.~
@179  = ~I'll look if I want to, Viconia. Deal with it. You are under no obligation to look back.~
@180  = ~You're attractive... for a rivvil. A bit more toned and lanky for my tastes, but pleasing to the eye nonetheless.~
@181  = ~Is that so? I suppose you prefer bodies that are soft and silky like your own, rather than the scarred and toughened body of a warrior.~
@182  = ~On the contrary, muscles and scars stir my lust in the most delicious manner... in men. On women, it's revolting. Women should be soft and curvaceous, not unlike myself. Perhaps if you give up the life of a thug, you could develop a more womanly figure.~
@183  = ~I am a warrior, drow. I was born a warrior and I'll die a warrior. I am no thug. Think what you like about my figure, but by the lustful gazes I've received from more men and women than I could care to count, I doubt many share your views that I am unfeminine.~
@184  = ~Perhaps. Surfacers have such strange notions about beauty and companionship. I'll never understand them completely. Enough. We have a quest to complete, and your mindless drivel is boring me.~
@185  = ~You're a fine priestess, Viconia. Though at times I think you should be a bit quicker to heal my wounds. You cut it rather close at times.~
@186  = ~If you wore armor like a proper warrior, you wouldn't receive so many wounds, waele j'nesst.~
@187  = ~By the way, Viconia, my training did not just include the arts of war. I also learned to read at a young age, in several languages.~
@188  = ~What is your point, surfacer?~
@189  = ~Just that the next time you call someone a stupid woman, you should hope that they don't speak Drow, hawrest ssindossa.~
@190  = ~Such language. I am impressed, barbarian, that you can speak any language other than common, let alone such a language as the Drow's.~
@191  = ~I am a woman of many talents, Viconia.~
@192  = ~Indeed. If you were a bit more masculine, or at the very least more feminine, I might have been interested in exploring those talents, since as you say, I am an insolent whore.~
@193  = ~Your compliments are so shrouded in insult as to be quite flattering, Viconia. Thank you.~
@194  = ~Quiet, na'ceroth, I have a reputation to uphold. Also, please consider putting on at least some leather armor. I daresay you'd run into battle nude if you could.~
@195  = ~Actually...~
@196  = ~Enough. You hold my interest no longer, surfacer. <CHARNAME> looks to be in the mood for a chat.~
@197  = ~Enough. You hold my interest no longer, surfacer. <CHARNAME> looks to be in the mood for a chat, go bother her and leave me alone.~
@198  = ~If you weren't so brutish, you might make a fine priestess of Shar, na'ceroth.~
@199  = ~I am a priestess in my own right, sha'lerniis. Yr'kai warriors are trained to be field medics, clergy, and scholars, as well as masters of the sword. A well balanced warrior is a deadly warrior.~
@200  = ~Is that so? I suppose you're as close to a priestess of this Akadia as one can be, given your lineage.~
@201  = ~I wouldn't really consider myself a priestess, no matter my upbringing or clerical duties. I am a warrior, just a well-rounded and intelligent warrior.~
@202  = ~You're suingmc, sometimes, but amusing as well. You have me at a disadvantage though, colnbluth. You speak the language of the drow, but I do not speak Yr'kai. What did you call me earlier, if you would be so kind as to inform me?~
@203  = ~I called you the same thing you called me, Viconia. A barbarian. If you do not like it, then desist in calling me by that name as well.~
@204  = ~Are you sure you have no Drow blood running through your veins? You appear human enough, but your mother's heritage may be the reason for that.~
@205  = ~Actually, I never met my father. Though it's possible he was Drow or part Drow, I doubt it. But, saying he is or is not is an assumption, so I will not make it. Regardless, thank you for the compliment.~
@206  = ~I am not complimenting you, waeles. I despise the Drow these days. Speak to me no more, I tire of our games.~
@207  = ~Aerie, by the gods, if I hear one more whine about your damnable lost wings, I'm going to take your blasted legs off as well!~
@208  = ~Why must you speak to me in such a hostile manner? I-I've said nothing cross towards you!~
@209  = ~I'm sorry, Aerie. I know it's hard but you have to get over it, or at least quit whining about it so much. You only make it harder on yourself everytime you remind yourself of your loss.~
@210  = ~I don't need to remind myself of my loss, Chloe. Everytime I forget and try to stretch my wings or reach back to caress them and even when I dream of flying through the clouds, I am reminded of my wings.~
@211  = ~I sometimes get an itch down at the tip of my right wing... It's silly, I know. I don't have my wings anymore but sometimes... sometimes I still feel them. And it makes it *so* much harder.~
@212  = ~All I can say is I'm sorry and I hope things get better for you. I didn't mean to upset you, I just don't want to see this loss destroy you.~
@213  = ~I shall try to keep my whining to myself from now on.~
@214  = ~Chloe?~
@215  = ~Yes, Aerie?~
@216  = ~Your people... the Yr'kai? Did they not make war with the Avariel nearly a century ago? I heard they found an Avariel settlement up on a mountain in the north...~
@217  = ~Yes. The Yr'kai have been at war with nearly everyone at one time or another. They... we... are very aggressive. They were looking for a good place to build a stockade, and low and behold, there was a ready-made one before them. The Yr'kai were greedy... and perhaps a bit desperate because of the impending war as well.~
@218  = ~Why are they so warlike?~
@219  = ~The Yr'kai aren't farmers. They aren't craftsmen. They aren't merchants. They only know how to do one thing... fight. Fight with a sword, to be more precise. They make their living as mercenaries now for the most part, sending extra food and money to the villages back home.~
@220  = ~But before that, they made war on everyone around them. They raided supply routes for food and supplies, and they lived a nomadic life.~
@221  = ~What changed, then?~
@222  = ~We made too many enemies. A good many of them allied together and struck the Yr'kai nearly 50 years ago in a united front. My people were nearly wiped out. The Yr'kai were forced to sign peace agreements that they would never make war as a people again. Thus now, they're mercenaries and only fight in other peoples' wars.~
@223  = ~Why don't they just take up farming, crafting, or become merchants *now* then? Why continue fighting?~
@224  = ~I suppose it would be like telling a fox to quit hunting hares. Trying to force a hawk to begin eating berries and nuts. Fighting is who the Yr'kai have been for nearly as long as history has been written down. I imagine it is who they will be until the last Yr'kai falls in battle.~
@225  = ~Oh my... how sad. So hostile, a whole tribe of people.~
@226  = ~The Avariel aren't very aggressive then, I take it?~
@227  = ~The Avariel are artists, priests, and singers. We have hunters for food and protection... when necessary. But we chose isolation to aggression. We could have become bandits, as it were... but we chose to disappear and be forgotten.~
@228  = ~How lonely. Perhaps our people could learn a lot from each other and both be the better for it.~
@229  = ~Perhaps someday, yes.~
@230  = ~That's the fifth time today you've reached back to feel your wingstumps, Aerie. You're not going to start whining about them again, are you? I thought you had gone past that.~
@231  = ~I certainly hope this isn't going to be another lecture. I'm *sick* of getting lectured!~
@232  = ~No... no. You're right, you've heard it enough, and you seemed to have moved past the loss of your wings. And that's why I'm concerned. Is something else on your mind?~
@233  = ~Nothing to be concerned about, Chloe. I still miss my wings, even if I've accepted their loss.~
@234  = ~You're very beautiful, Aerie.~
@235  = ~Wha... what?~
@236  = ~I'm just saying you're beautiful. I get the feeling you're unsure of that.~
@237  = ~Um... thank you. But my scars... do they not make me hideous to behold? Would you cuddle with someone who had lumps of scar tissue on their back?~
@238  = ~Sure. I doubt I would even notice the scars. And even if I did, I wouldn't think any less of her. You should have a look at some of *my* scars. Some are quite ghastly.~
@239  = ~But they give me definition. They make me unique. Each scar is an experience I've survived. Your scars mark you as a survivor. I like that about you. Despite your loss, you've flourished.~
@240  = ~Thank you. Your praise means a lot. But um.. Chloe?~
@241  = ~I-I'm not interested in you in *that* way, if you understand? Uh, no offense meant, you're... you're very lovely, but ...~
@242  = ~Aerie?~
@243  = ~Y-yes?~
@244  = ~I'm glad you're flattered, but I wasn't asking to bed you. A bit of a flirt, yes, but no seriousness was intended. I was just complimenting you.~
@245  = ~Oh... ok. Um... thank you.~
@246  = ~(chuckles)~
@247  = ~Ye've done impressed me, long limbs, with yer prowess in battle, though yer sickening beardless chin be havin' a part in the defeat of yer enemies, I've no doubt.~
@248  = ~It fills me with no small sense of joy that you so approve of my fighting skills, but even more so that you'll not be lusting after me like a dog in heat.~
@249  = ~I kin see why only the other skinny lasses find yer looks pleasin'. Yer frightfully pale, hairless an' over-tall. Me ale nearly comes spillin' back up from lookin' at ye.~
@250  = ~Such lovely imagery. I think it would take a whole lot more than my features, unpleasant as they may be, to pry even a drop of ale from you, however.~
@251  = ~A point ye may be havin', I be reckoning. Ye still make me stomach queasy by tha sight of ye, though ye at least smell pleasant enough. Blood an' sweat leave a might tasty after-smell upon a lass, I'll admit.~
@252  = ~I *do* bathe when possible, dwarf, unlike you. Next time we pass a river, I feel it would be in the best interests of the party to push you in. Perhaps your smell will improve a bit.~
@253  = ~Ye'll do no such thing, ye lily-white gangly-limbed lanky slip of a poor excuse for a woman! Dwarves kin't swim, and have lil' enough desire ta learn!~
@254  = ~All the more reason to push you into the water then, I should say. Perhaps at the very least we should shave your beard off, it's infested with fleas.~
@255  = ~A dwarf's beard is his most prized possession. Ye'll have to kill me if'n ye want to remove it.~
@256  = ~Hmm. Though it would be fun chopping you into bite sized chunks, I shall pass for now. I've reconsidered, after all. If you're that ugly *with* your beard, I dare say you'd be even more horrid to behold bare-faced.~
@257  = ~Hah! I think if ye weren't so blasted tall and skinny, an' had a fine beard on yer chin, ye might make a right pleasin' dwarf, long-legs. One I'd delight in showing the limits uh dwarven passion. Har har!~
@258  = ~That, Korgan, is the single most disgusting thing anyone has ever said to me. Congratulations. Pardon me while I vomit and attempt to rid myself of that mental picture. Yuck!~
@259  = ~Must you relieve yourself on every single corpse that falls by your axe, dwarf? It's disgusting, and I could have lived a fulfilled life without seeing the shriveled worm you hide in your breeches.~
@260  = ~I want these worm-eaten gully-rollers ta know's it was Korgan Bloodaxe that did send them inta the afterlife, and be wearin' me stinkin' piss when's they find themselves there! Har har! If'n it be botherin' ye that much, turn yer blasted eyes in another direction and shut yer hole about me business.~
@261  = ~Vile wretch. Someday, sooner I reckon rather than later, it'll be your stinking corpse that stains the ground, and mayhap you'll find the one who struck the fatal blow has left their wet mark upon your body as well. I look forward to seeing that.~
@262  = ~I've nay doubt ye'd be tickled through ta be the one ta do the pissin'. But I'll nay give ye the chance. Best be watchin' yer back. Now shut yer bloody mouth and leave me be! I've dead ta mark before we continue on. If'n ye want to watch, fetch me an ale ta refill me bladder. Har har!~
@263  = ~Though I respect your skills in battle, must you be so bloodthirsty? I find myself continuously surprised that you don't attack the rest of us as well.~
@264  = ~If'n I do ye'd be sure ye'd be the first to find me axe in yer belly. Now bother someone else with yer mewlin', 'fore I start a hackin' wit' me axe again.~
@265  = ~I'm beginning to think that you're making more enemies than you're dispatching, dwarf. And I'd rather not be standing at your side when those enemies come to find you.~
@266  = ~I know yer a bit on the tall side and I've nay doubt that the air up there be thin an' that effects yer judgment, but I'd not taken ye for a yellow-bellied coward till now, long-legs.~
@267  = ~It has nothing to do with cowardice. I kill when I must to survive, and I admit I've a bit more aggression in me than some of the other party-members, but I focus my rage on our enemies, not every passerby who happens to glance my way.~
@268  = ~The road ta glory is paved by the many corpses we leave behind, long-limb. Though it looks like ye won't be leaving many more corpses besides yer own.~
@269  = ~And what, pray tell, is that supposed to mean?~
@270  = ~I'd thought ye ta be skilled in battle, but I admit I'm finding ye to be more lucky than skilled. Ye flail about like yer drunk and strike wildly like ye don't even know how ta aim properly. I'm waitin' for ye to strike yer own ugly head off, ye bowel-hive. An' I've nay doubt it'll be soon.~
@271  = ~You stinking maggot-sucking flea-bitten sewer smelling dwarf! How *dare* you mock my battle skills! I could carve my name in your fat belly before you could even heft that over-heavy axe for a blow!~
@272  = ~Har! I love a good challenge, ye blasted swaggerin' giant! But ye amuse me enough to let ye live a while longer. Are ye sure there's no dwarf in ye? There could be tonight if I kin imagine ye with a beard...~
@273  = ~By the gods, you say the most revolting things, you blasted gully-dwarf! Leave me be, your rank odor is making me ill.~
@274  = ~So Valleygirl, why is it that you hate magic so much?~
@275  = ~Pardon me, Chloe, but my name is Valygar. I think, perhaps, you should wear a helmet into battle so you don't take so many knocks to the head.~
@276  = ~My apologies, I must have misheard. Now that we have that out of the way, I would appreciate an answer to my question.~
@277  = ~I don't hate magic. I think magic is abused far more than it is used for good purposes, so I'd much rather do without it altogether.~
@278  = ~Well, the same could be said for anything. Swords can be misused by anyone who can lift one up, should we get rid of them as well?~
@279  = ~A world without violence? Certainly. Such a thing would be a true blessing.~
@280  = ~Any stick of wood can be used for a weapon as well. I suppose we should get rid of the wood as well. Animals can be trained to attack people, so away with them as well.~
@281  = ~Now look here, you go too far, Yr'kai.~
@282  = ~I am making a point, ranger. The tool should never be the object of scorn, only the people who misuse those tools. Anything can be turned into a weapon, even words. Magic does far more good in the world than it does ill. Accept it, or remove yourself from this world.~
@283  = ~I shall respectfully disagree with you on this.~
@284  = ~That is your choice, of course.~
@285  = ~You should learn to use a bow, Chloe. They are quite useful, you know.~
@286  = ~There is no honor in killing an opponent from a distance and in the back, ranger. I fight with skill and honor, face to face. My god and goddess would be quite upset with me should I start to not give my opponents at least the chance of survival.~
@287  = ~I follow no gods, so I care not for their judgments upon my life or my tactics. Perhaps things would be different had my family not been so self-destructive.~
@288  = ~You whine too much about magic and your family. Get over it; you're boring the rest of us. Develop some thicker skin, or simply shut your mouth and do your part in the group, I don't care which you choose.~
@289  = ~As you wish. Perhaps as I learn to stay quiet, you will learn how to use a bow so we do not always have to run wild and screaming into battle.~
@290  = ~My lady, it fills me with no small sense of wonder that you have not attempted to converse with me as of yet. You've nary cast an eye my way, in fact!~
@291  = ~And why does this surprise you so, Anomen?~
@292  = ~Why, I would think my righteous exploits and my noble bearing would interest you at least in some small manner, my lady.~
@293  = ~Why?~
@294  = ~Er... why? Why not? I do not understand you, m'lady. I confess you are a quandary to me.~
@295  = ~I have no interest in your pompous fluttering about like the peacock you are. What's more, is I have no interest in your manly bearing, noble or otherwise.~
@296  = ~Oh... I see. You're far more interested in the doe-eyed peasant girls than in the heroic and noble men such as myself. That makes sense, I suppose.~
@297  = ~Though it is true that I have no interest in men at all, I have even less interest in you. I should think that even if I did have an interest in men, I would still find you lacking in the basic requirements of manliness.~
@298  = ~I'll not stand here and be insulted by the likes of you, wench. Keep your distance from me, from this day forth.~
@299  = ~Aw, I ruffled the peacock's feathers. Too bad. Get over yourself, Anomen. You're not as interesting as you seem to think.~
@300  = ~Hmph. I shall be the one to refrain from continuing this verbal joust in the interest of peace amongst comrades.~
@301  = ~It fills me with no small sense of wonder, good sir, that you have not fallen over yourself in praise of my superior combat skills.~
@302  = ~Hmmph. And why should I fawn over your skills, be they superior or not, my lady?~
@303  = ~Oh, I see. I had assumed that you tripped over yourself and worshipped anyone with breasts, but I suppose your fawning is reserved for <CHARNAME>.~
@304  = ~Yes, well she is far more pleasant than you could ever hope to be, woman. And I'll not have you insinuate otherwise.~
@305  = ~Please, Anomen. You do far more than fawn. (mocking Anomen's voice) Oh, <CHARNAME>! Let me bore you with my tales! I killed a kobold once! Oh, what shall I do now? Potato cakes or beef stew for supper tonight? Please, choose for me, <CHARNAME>!~
@306  = ~Desist your mockery at once, churlish wench! Stay out of my affairs. And I would ask you to desist in your glances towards <CHARNAME> as well! She has no interest in you or your feminine wiles!~
@307  = ~(chuckling) I so love to rile you up, Anomen. But I shall leave you to your pouting now, however righteous and noble you think it be.~
@308  = ~So Anomen, how does it feel to have a Sir before your name now?~
@309  = ~It fills my heart with pride every time I hear my name spoken thus, good lady.~
@310  = ~Yes, I've heard you repeating "Sir Anomen" to yourself many a time under your breath. It's getting a bit annoying.~
@311  = ~I still find myself in awe that the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart has found me worthy to be counted amongst their number. I shall be in awe of the Order my entire life.~
@312  = ~Yes. It matters little that they're all a bunch of over-zealous pompous windbags who consider themselves superior to everyone else, and slays any who speak otherwise.~
@313  = ~My lady, I would ask you hold your tongue when speaking ill of the Order. I shall not let you ruin this day with your nay-saying, so I shall ignore it this time and this time only. I pray you bid me peace and let me bask in the joy of my accomplishment.~
@314  = ~Hmm. Alright. Though I care little for your Order, I do congratulate you on your accomplishment nonetheless. Now maybe you'll keep quiet with all your whining about whether you're worthy or not.~
@315  = ~I thank you for your praise, my lady. Strained as it were.~
@316  = ~So Anomen, finally free of the Order's fanatical deathgrip, eh?~
@317  = ~Yes, and not a moment too soon. So much of my life chasing after their impossible standards. Bah. Good riddence!~
@318  = ~I commend your attitude. I was quite worried that you'd become self-destructive after being turned away. It was, after all, your life's ambition to be a knight of the Order.~
@319  = ~Arrogant bastards, the lot of them. I've never felt so free as I do on this day. Though I failed, I feel I've gained something so much better. Enough of this, let us be off. I'll speak of the Order no more this day.~
@320  = ~Commendable. I congratulate you on your new outlook. I prefer you as you are now. Your personality is almost bearable.~
@321  = ~So you actually spent a year sitting out in the forest and never even sought shelter?~
@322  = ~Verily, I made my nest under nature's bounty for a full cycle of seasons, feeling all of nature's essence and power upon my being, just as a tiny sapling makes root and becomes an expansive great oak tree.~
@323  = ~Right... but you're not a tree. You're a human. You do realize this, I trust?~
@324  = ~Certainly. I am the young hawk being dropped from the nest to learn to fly. I am the wolf cub being taught to hunt with the pack. I am the young deer taking its first steps away from its mother. I am all these things, as well as the young man making his way in the world by nature's grace.~
@325  = ~Uh huh... do you always talk in metaphor, or are you intentionally trying to confuse me?~
@326  = ~My intentions are to wrap my very words in nature's loving embrace, just as the mother fox wraps her body around her young to keep them warm. Just as the...~
@327  = ~Right... right. Please forget I asked.~
@328  = ~Certainly. Just as the fish forgets what lies on the other side of the pond and must constantly travel from one side to the other in new discovery, I shall forget your words so they are fresh and anew when next we converse.~
@329  = ~(Sigh)~
@330  = ~Ah, my friends! My child is safely tucked away with the druids here and I am eager to resume our journeys. Shall we flock together like the birds in the sky once more?~
@331  = ~You *are* jesting, are you not, druid?~
@332  = ~No jest, my lady of the sword, I am eager to share your company once more.~
@333  = ~You just found out you have a baby. Don't you think you should stay and take care of it? You are a father now.~
@334  = ~My child shall await the day I return. I must follow the call of nature, after all.~
@335  = ~I think the call of nature had better lead you back over to your child so you can take care of him.~
@336  = ~Is... there some problem between us that I am not aware of?~
@337  = ~Damned right. If you abandon your child I will kill you. The choice is yours.~
@338  = ~Nay, stay your sword. <CHARNAME>, the choice is yours my friend. Shall I rejoin you?~
@339  = ~Cernd, the choice is *MINE*, not <PRO_HISHER>'s! If you take one step more away from your child I shall split you in twain and fertilize this grove with your bloody corpse. You have a responsibility towards your child which you shall not abandon in my presence.~
@340  = ~I... feel I should reconsider then. <CHARNAME>, always a pleasure to see you again my friend, but I feel I must stay here and tend to my child. Just as the...~
@341  = ~Stay your tongue. If you're not in our party, we don't have to listen to your incessant metaphors. Be gone. Return to your child and apologize to him for even considering leaving.~
@342  = ~Farewell, my friends.~
@343  = ~That tune you're whistling, Jan... where did you hear it? It's quite similar to a Yr'kai song in praise of Akadia.~
@344  = ~Well it's a funny story, Chloe. My uncle Hatchback Jansen, quite a lively fellow indeed, was journeying north in search of a tastier turnip, quite an undertaking indeed.~
@345  = ~Yes I'm sure... turnips, the eternal quest for perfection. Something I'm very familiar with. Go on.~
@346  = ~He encountered a small band of kobolds. Frightful fellows indeed. They gave chase to poor old Hatchback, whose never so much as picked up a dagger, you see?~
@347  = ~He came to a small cave and darted inside and hid for a time, praying to every gnomish god and even some of the other gods he could think of that they wouldn't find him.~
@348  = ~Well apparently the gnomish gods didn't like that he prayed to some of the other ones, because one of the young kobolds had doubled back to fetch a sack he had dropped and happened to spy old Hatchback as he peeked his head out of the hole.~
@349  = ~Is this story going anywhere anytime this tenday?~
@350  = ~Yes yes, quit interrupting me. So the kobold chased Hatchback until the other kobolds caught up to them. They placed him into their cook pot, quick as you please. Kobolds like to boil their dinner alive, you see.~
@351  = ~So they ate him?~
@352  = ~No, of course not! How silly. Would I have heard this story had he not survived?~
@353  = ~Um... I guess not.~
@354  = ~Now where was I? Oh yes, so Hatchback worked furiously at the ropes binding him, they were old frayed ropes and weren't in the best of shape of course, so he was able to work himself loose without too much of a fuss.~
@355  = ~He pretended to be dead and the kobolds went to get some spices and vegetables I suppose, I imagine some turnips at the very least.~
@356  = ~Of course. Gotta have the turnips in gnome stew, bring the flavor out.~
@357  = ~...Yes,yes now where was I? Hatchback eventually found some turnips, but they weren't any different than the turnips we have close to home, possibly not even as tasty. Can you imagine that? What a horrid notion, turnips that aren't as delicious and satisfying as turnips elsewhere...~
@358  = ~Ok...~
@359  = ~On his way home, he hummed that tune to himself, glad to have survived his ordeal. And that's how I learned it, when he told me that story.~
@360  = ~Ok... but where did he hear it from?~
@361  = ~How am I supposed to know? I didn't ask!~
@362  = ~Blasted gnome, you could have said that in the first place.~
@363  = ~And deprive you of the knowledge of Uncle Hatchback's kobold adventure? How could I do such a thing in good conscience!?~
@364  = ~Chlo, you remind me a bit of my niece, Jana Jansen.~
@365  = ~My name is Chloe, gnome. Is two syllables a bit too much for your tiny brain?~
@366  = ~As I was saying, Chlo... my niece is one of those lezerans too.~
@367  = ~You mean lesbian?~
@368  = ~No, lezerans. Do you have water in your ears? She's always flirting with all the little gnome girls. In fact, she's been known to hit on the halfling girls, as well.~
@369  = ~I imagine she'd be all flustered trying to get a kiss from Mazzy, here.~
@370  = ~Excuse me? What makes you think I'd kiss a gnome, especially a *female* gnome? And may I ask that you refrain from using my name in your horrid little stories, Jan?~
@371  = ~Jan, the word is lesbian, not lezeran. Do you have some head injury the rest of the party should be aware of?~
@372  = ~No, not that I remember. But that reminds me of my grandfather Jaco Jansen. He had a head injury where he would...~
@373  = ~So the only reason I remind you of your niece is because we both like other girls?~
@374  = ~Well there's that and the sour disposition. And the tendency to interrupt others when they're trying to tell a story. As well as...~
@375  = ~Enough gnome. You're beginning to annoy me.~
@376  = ~As I said, a sour disposition. <CHARNAME> never tries to quiet me when I'm telling a story.~
@377  = ~That's because <CHARNAME> has the good sense to tune you out. A habit I think I should get quite practiced at.~
@378  = ~You've hurt my feelings, Chlo. No turnips for you tonight at dinner.~
@379  = ~You disgust me, thief.~
@380  = ~My pardons, dear lady. May I ask what I have done to earn your ire?~
@381  = ~You're always talking about how famous you are, and such as that. What good is a famous thief, except as a lure for yet more enemies?~
@382  = ~I had not thought you to be cowardly enough to fear enemies. I beg forgiveness, good lady.~
@383  = ~It is a matter of survival to not take on more enemies than one can handle, rogue. Your famed thieving brings nothing but invited misery upon our heads.~
@384  = ~I cannot help it if tales of my exploits have reached the ears of some. Why is this any different from the perils that <CHARNAME> brings to the group with rumors of <PRO_HISHER> accomplishments?~
@385  = ~<CHARNAME> is a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, who has benefited far more than <PRO_HESHE> has harmed. And there are no tales of the wanton thievery and random destructive acts in bars that I have been hearing about you.~
@386  = ~We all have sordid pasts, mistress. No doubt a good many of the tales I've heard of Chloe out of Akadia of the Yr'kai tribe are true, and I dare say you've earned us an enemy or two as well.~
@387  = ~Perhaps. I shall be sure that their retaliations fall on your head instead of my own, however. And never doubt that you have earned it.~
@388  = ~As you wish, mistress.~
@389  = ~I find myself curious as to what it is like to be the child of a goddess, especially one so powerful as Akadia.~
@390  = ~Are you speaking to yourself, or to me, rogue?~
@391  = ~I have put the curiosity out for general conversation, however I feel you are the most likely to respond to my musings...~
@392  = ~Hmph. If that is how you wish to play it. To tell the truth I doubt I'm much different from any normal mortal. But then the way I was raised may play a part in such thinking.~
@393  = ~How so?~
@394  = ~The Yr'kai train their young physically, mentally, and psychologically to be the perfect warriors, or as near perfect as one can attain in their own lifetime. So it's near impossible to tell how much of my prowess comes from my mother's blood and how much from my upbringing.~
@395  = ~Ah yes, the age old debate of nature versus nurture. You are a mystery, no matter the case.~
@396  = ~And I shall remain so to you, thief.~
@397  = ~Sometimes I get the feeling you'd like nothing better than to dump out all our coin onto the street so the beggars could swarm over it like rodents, Nalia.~
@398  = ~I don't really care for your comparisons of the poor, Chloe. Regardless, I know enough to only give of our extra coin. We have plenty, it's not like we'd miss a few coins.~
@399  = ~A few coins or no, that money is going to the cause of rescuing <CHARNAME>'s sister. Every moment gathering coin is another moment she rots in that prison. Or worse, in the hands of that psychopath. He was only overcome because he agreed to go, he may have broken free and killed everyone as far as we know.~
@400  = ~Oh, don't be so dramatic, Chloe. A coin here and there won't delay the rescue of Imoen. But it'll make a world of difference to a beggar with nothing.~
@401  = ~Just be careful you limit it to a coin or two here and there. I see how your hand twitches on your coin purse every time someone who is wearing less than silk walks by.~
@402  = ~I can control myself, Chloe. Control your tongue when speaking to me of this matter, as well.~
@403  = ~You're rather attractive, Nalia.~
@404  = ~Thank you, Chloe. You're quite lovely as well.~
@405  = ~You remind me a bit of my first lover.~
@406  = ~Oh? How so?~
@407  = ~She was a noble as well. The youngest daughter of Lord Kegan D'Martine.~
@408  = ~I know the D'Martine's a bit from my father's dealings with them. I think I may have met her once. Theresa, was it not?~
@409  = ~That's the one.~
@410  = ~Interesting. What happened?~
@411  = ~Lord D'Martine arranged for her to marry Duke Andros of Greymist. It was a great honor, of course. Increased her noble standing, and all that.~
@412  = ~Both sad and happy news, I suppose.~
@413  = ~Yes. The price of nobility is sometimes one's own happiness. She's miserable, last I heard. But she has three children, all of whom are wealthier and in a higher class than she was growing up. So she thinks it's worth it.~
@414  = ~I suppose. The dealings of the nobility often leave a sour taste in my mouth. But I'm quite accustomed to it, nevertheless. I had planned on marrying a noble of a similar mind as mine concerning the poor. Or at least a nice young man who wouldn't upset anyone too much.~
@415  = ~Ever have any dalliances of your own?~
@416  = ~A few, yes. One was a local boy by the name of Beran. He was handsome, but painfully dull and even duller of wit. But he was sweet. Then there was Marietta, a chamber maid. My parents were none too thrilled to learn of that one. They sent her whole family to the Roenalls. It's one thing to dally around with the staff, but one must never ever be caught doing so, after all. I still feel guilty about that.~
@417  = ~Hmm. Well, perhaps you'll find someone who will make you happy?~
@418  = ~We all hope for that, Chloe. Let us catch up to the others. I get a bit nervous when I lose sight of them.~
@419  = ~Of course. But I will protect you if needed. (grins)~
@420  = ~Hmm.~
@421  = ~What do you think of the nobility, Chloe?~
@422  = ~A bunch of stuffed shirts who waste space and suck up money and food they don't earn, most of them. There are a few exceptions, of course.~
@423  = ~Of course. I tend to agree with you, however. The nature of the nobility must change. The separation of the wealthy noble and the poor peasant is too great. The only way one can make something of themselves is to become an adventurer, and then they either die on the road and lose everything or end up becoming a noble in their own right and the cycle continues.~
@424  = ~The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, right?~
@425  = ~Exactly. There has to be a middle ground that develops. A middle class that is not just the prosperous merchant or the poor noble.~
@426  = ~I'm not sure I understand what you mean.~
@427  = ~Well... I mean using some of the extra wealth of the upper class and distributing it evenly amongst the poor. It would raise the standard of living of the poor without harming the wealthy to any great extent.~
@428  = ~Then, because everyone would have more money, prices would rise and soon the poor would be back to where they were, except then the rich would suffer as well because the 5000 gold that was in their coffers is suddenly only worth what is now 2000 gold.~
@429  = ~Hmm... I hadn't considered that.~
@430  = ~Also, the rich wouldn't give up their gold without a fight. And how would you distribute it evenly amongst the poor? There would be a riot as the more violent poor tried to get more than their share from the weaker peasants.~
@431  = ~I guess I should put more thought into this. Sometimes I think I see things so clearly then someone shows me errors that I hadn't seen myself. Thank you, Chloe.~
@432  = ~No problem. Your heart is in the right place. Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions anymore.~
@433  = ~Perhaps a government position where taxation and distribution of goods could be affected? I'll consider this more carefully.~
@434  = ~I must confess, m'lady, your actions prove a quandary beyond my comprehension.~
@435  = ~How so, paladin?~
@436  = ~More often than not your actions and words are on the noble and righteous path, but there are times when you advise <CHARNAME> to commit unspeakable acts. This makes little sense to me. Do you advise what you would not do yourself?~
@437  = ~Hah... nobility... righteousness, such strange notions.~
@438  = ~I... do not understand your meaning, m'lady. I find your words bordering on sacrilegious.~
@439  = ~Oh, stay your sword, paladin. I can speak my mind without being attacked for words, can I not?~
@440  = ~Of course... to a point.~
@441  = ~Anyway, I do what I feel is best for myself and this party. Often that is the nice thing to do which benefits many. It's advantageous to have a popular reputation. However, one must occasionally get one's hands dirty to benefit the most or to get the least involved with matters that do not concern us.~
@442  = ~Wherever evil intentions fester, we must strike them down. Those actions that lead to chaos, we must prevent.~
@443  = ~I suppose, but it is not always best to get involved. Sometimes your actions do no good other than earning you more enemies. There is little point in that.~
@444  = ~I am the enemy of all that are evil. I would have it no other way.~
@445  = ~What is evil? It's an abstract concept to describe why some people use power for their own ends, or to explain away someone's cruelty. It's an excuse, nothing more.~
@446  = ~I disagree, most heartily. Evil stems from the selfish gods that seek chaos and absolute power, and take root in the most shadowed corners of men's hearts. Evil exists, whether you believe in it or not.~
@447  = ~Perhaps. Or perhaps some are simply more selfish than others, or more honest about their selfishness. It matters little. No matter someone's motivations, when they cause harm and it's best to get involved, we do so. Calling them evil just makes it easier on our conscience to strike them down.~
@448  = ~Your intentions are just for the moment. Whether or not you believe in the wiles of evil matter little in the end, so long as you stand against them. Carry on, Yr'kai.~
@449  = ~You've been giving me a most peculiar look all day, Keldorn. Speak your mind, or cease your awkward gazing.~
@450  = ~I find my heart pulled in two directions concerning you, m'lady...~
@451  = ~Um... I'm flattered, Keldorn, but you're married and I'm not into the whole masculine thing...~
@452  = ~By Torm, bite your tongue, woman! I meant no such thing!~
@453  = ~Explain yourself then, paladin. Speak it plain.~
@454  = ~By all rights I should find you an evil that needs to be removed. And yet, you fight on the side of good, so I cannot bring myself to challenge you.~
@455  = ~Evil because of my parentage, or because of my selfish motivations?~
@456  = ~Your motivations. They are shrouded in secrecy. I tend to think you could just as easily be carving a path of blood and misery in your wake.~
@457  = ~Perhaps I could at that. Does it matter, however? Here I stand beside yourself and <CHARNAME>; battling all these evils you're so fond of naming. Whether I would do so on my own or not matters not, as a result. I am here, and doing these good things, as you say. Is that not enough? Must I spout righteous platitudes as well?~
@458  = ~Nay, m'lady, I suppose it is well and good enough, so long as you continue by our sides. I worry for when you strike out upon your own, however.~
@459  = ~I would not worry about it, Keldorn. I feel my place is here, at least until <CHARNAME> has finished with <PRO_HISHER> quests. And who knows, that day may never come.~
@460  = ~Well and true enough, m'lady. I shall not bother you with my concerns again, unless it proves necessary. May Torm's favor guide you.~
@461  = ~I say, good lady! I find myself more impressed by the day of your awe inspiring skills on the battlefield! I've never seen a more skilled and quick warrior! Bravo!~
@462  = ~I am most pleased with your own skills, good paladin. Though age has slowed you down a bit, your passion and courage more than compensate.~
@463  = ~I thank thee, m'lady. I watch you every day in awe, however grueling our day, you always find time to practice, and never is it a short practice, rather you seem to push yourself further each night.~
@464  = ~But how do you manage this feat without becoming too fatigued to battle our enemies? I imagine it is due to your divine heritage?~
@465  = ~Nay, my mother's blood has little to do with it, I'd wager. Every Yr'kai practices until the muscles burn each night, no matter how exhausting the day is or how pressed for time. We have always practiced this way, pushing the limits of perfection. There is always room for improvement. Always.~
@466  = ~That is rightfully so, good lady. I find myself envious of your youthful vigor. Would that I were 20 years younger, I would ask to practice with you, at least for a time.~
@467  = ~Why do you feel you must be young to do so? There was a warrior in my village... he neared his 60th winter when last I saw him. He had been in 7 wars, countless campaigns, and had nearly as many scars as years of life. And yet he practiced for longer, pushed himself harder, than even I am capable as of yet. And he still had plenty of energy when it was needed.~
@468  = ~Truly an inspiring man. But my skills are rooted in strength and conviction. I fear my speed has suffered more than I care to admit.~
@469  = ~Oh, please. Paladin, your complaining upsets me. You will begin to practice with me for a minimum of one hour each night after we make camp. You will do this each night, even if you find yourself begging for healing and poultices to place on your aching muscles. You will improve, or you will die trying. Do I make myself clear?~
@470  = ~My lady, I am grateful for the offer, but I am too old to be...~
@471  = ~Silence. From this day forth I am your torque, your teacher. I will not push you farther than you can handle, but I will push you. And you will improve. Pledge yourself to my tutelage now, good sir, if you know what is best for you.~
@472  = ~I...I agree, then. Perhaps Torm has guided me to you to better my service to the Order. May Torm have mercy on me, for I know that you shall not.~
@473  = ~Have you been happy with the practicing thus far, my tuh'lin... my student?~
@474  = ~Aye... every night I lay upon my bedding and I know in my heart that I shall die of aches and exhaustion. And yet every morning I wake up, and feel less of the pain in my joints that I felt more and more each passing winter. And yet my muscles still ache from the training.~
@475  = ~My muscles ache each morning as well, as they have since I was a mere child. I have grown accustomed to it, as shall you. I am proud of your progress; you're doing far better than I had hoped. I must confess that I had a bit of doubt that you would last even 10 minutes of training each night, let alone an hour.~
@476  = ~You... you expected me to die of exhaustion?! Is that what you are telling me?!~
@477  = ~Oh don't be so dramatic, paladin. Had I thought you had been pushed too far, I would have ceased the practice and gotten you some aid. Trust me.~
@478  = ~Though I trust you little on other matters, I trust you with my training. That is enough.~
@479  = ~You know... we're not so different, you and I.~
@480  = ~I beg your pardon, my lady?! I find myself insulted by your comment!~
@481  = ~Oh, don't get your breeches in a twist. I meant no offense. I was referring to the fact that we both fight in the service of our gods. I for Akadia and Lathandar, and you for Torm. There is a kinship, in that. I may not be a paladin, but I suppose I am a holy warrior in my own right.~
@482  = ~I beg to differ with the holy part, but you are definitely a great warrior and a boon to your gods. Any further similarity you feel you see between us, I would rather you kept your tongue on.~
@483  = ~As you would have it, paladin.~
@484  = ~So tell me, tiny one, why are you not a paladin? You're a holy warrior, your god Arvoreen even grants you some special abilities for your devotion, and yet you're still nothing more than a common warrior. Does Arvoreen not like you?~
@485  = ~Currently Arvoreen is not granting some of the special abilities that paladins are gifted with. Also, if you have not noticed until now, humans seem to be the only ones the gods bless with paladin status. I imagine it is some decision made by the gods that is beyond our ken.~
@486  = ~Ah, is that it. Well, I must say that if you are not a paladin, you shouldn't act like you are. I've heard enough about righteousness and all that rot to last a lifetime. I think perhaps that you should keep the holier-than-thou attitude to yourself and quit pestering the rest of us with it.~
@487  = ~The quest for goodness is everlasting. If my words bother you so, perhaps you harbor more evil in your heart than you let on. Regardless, no one is keeping you here. Carry on by yourself, if you choose.~
@488  = ~Or perhaps I'll not see you standing there, trip over you and break your neck, accidentally of course.~
@489  = ~I'll not stand idly by and be threatened. If you wish to take up arms against me, then do so now in an honorable fashion.~
@490  = ~I don't think <CHARNAME> would appreciate me slaughtering those that <PRO_HESHE> decides to travel with. My personal dislike for you is not so great as to stain my sword with your blood, however distasteful your manner.~
@491  = ~Then stay your tongue of the petty threats, Chloe. I've had to listen to such as that from tall folk for far longer than I care already.~
@492  = ~Chloe, I find your flippant disregard for the suffering of others to be insulting at best, and heartless at the worst.~
@493  = ~Thank you, little pretend paladin.~
@494  = ~That was not a compliment, tall one.~
@495  = ~And what is your point, other than your chin?~
@496  = ~Your pointless insults prove nothing but your own ignorance and callous disregard for others. But my point is your attitude is insufferable.~
@497  = ~I could say the same for the mindless drivel you spout out as if anyone cares. You earn us far too many enemies with your own attitude, Halfling, than I care for.~
@498  = ~I feel I should challenge you to a duel, Chloe. I know of little else that can still your wicked tongue.~
@499  = ~It would be your choice to die, Halfling. I care little enough for you, but I am not the leader of this group so I will respect peace amongst comrades, unless you force me to do otherwise.~
@500  = ~If that is your wish, then I shall try to be more accepting of you, as long as you do not stray from the path of right.~
@501  = ~<CHARNAME>, Mazzy will not stop her crusading until she brings death to us all with her suicidal actions. I advise you to rid us of her, here and now, before it is too late.~
@502  = ~I say I will respect the peace and you turn around and try to oust me from the group?! What kind of woman *are* you!?~
@503  = ~One who likes taking breath. Any enemies we earn, I prefer to earn together, and not because of one individuals agenda. Make your choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@504  = ~I cannot just kick her away, Chloe. She's earned her place amongst us, and I trust she will not bring ruin to us. She stays.~
@505  = ~I agree. I'm sorry, Mazzy, but you're too dangerous with your own agenda being forced upon the rest of us. It's best you leave the group.~
@506  = ~As you wish. Mazzy, do not betray <CHARNAME>'s trust, or I shall carve you up for dinner. I've heard Halfling steaks are excellent with a bit of lime.~
@507  = ~You disgust me, Chloe. Speak not to me again, and I shall do you the same courtesy.~
@508  = ~Truly, <CHARNAME>, I had not thought you this low. But if that is how you feel, I shall take my leave. I believe I will return to my home for a time in Trademeet. If you change your mind, seek me out there. Farewell my friends, it has been an honor.~
@509  = ~Well she wasn't too bad a person, but she was too dangerous to us all. I shall miss her in a way, but it was for the best. Let us carry on, shall we?~
@510  = ~My sweet war hawk, how are you this fine morn?~
@511  = ~...~
@512  = ~... Chloe?~
@513  = ~Yes, Haer'Dalis?~
@514  = ~Did you not hear my voice reaching out to you mere moments ago?~
@515  = ~I responded, did I not?~
@516  = ~A few moments before that, dear sweet war hawk.~
@517  = ~My name is Chloe. We are not on familiar enough terms for you to be giving me strange nicknames, bard.~
@518  = ~Ho! Thy words do wound this sparrow, true! Methinks yon war hawk has her claws out this day!~
@519  = ~You're beginning to bore me, actor. Entertain me with a song.~
@520  = ~Certainly, and I hope it pleases you, my war hawk.~
@521  = ~'Twas a fine morn indeed
            When first his eyes beheld she.
            His heart rang true, 'twas love
            Gifts of sweets and flowers and jewels,
            Did not bring together the fools,
            So the gods did turn them to doves.~
@522  = ~That was rather amusing, I thank you bard.~
@523  = ~My reward is thy smile, dear war hawk.~
@524  = ~A moment, dear war hawk, thy sweet voice I do beseech.~
@525  = ~Did you want something, or were you just growing restless from not hearing your own voice?~
@526  = ~I wished to ask you if you knew any great stories, or better yet, ballads of your people that you could share with this eager sparrow?~
@527  = ~I suppose I could share a story. There was once a Yr'kai warrior, his name was Erlos the Bold. Actually, it may have been Erlos the Bald. I was told the story by Faer'lin, who had a strange accent from his extensive travels in the far south.~
@528  = ~Yes, go on. Mine ears are twittering to behold such lovely narration.~
@529  = ~Excuse me?~
@530  = ~My apologies. Pray continue my lovely war hawk.~
@531  = ~Ahem. Ok. He fell in love with this lovely bard by the name of Kayla, yet she had little interest in him. He finally asked her how he could win her heart.~
@532  = ~A fine and noble pursuit, indeed.~
@533  = ~She replied that she yearned for a pearl-encrusted harp that had caught her fancy months before and she did not have the funds to purchase it and it was far too dangerous to attempt to steal it. She was saddened, as the harp seemed to call out to her whenever she passed the shop where it was displayed.~
@534  = ~Ah the call of an instrument. My own harp did cry out to me in such a way, my hands could not resist the call. I... pardon this sparrow; he did not intend to interrupt your fine tale.~
@535  = ~Interrupt again and the tale ends. I don't want to talk all day to you. Anyway, he beseeched the owner of the music shop to give him a good price for the harp, but the merchant would have none of it. Instead, he asked that the warrior do a simple job for him, the slaying of a rival shop owner. Against his better judgment, and spurred by love, he agreed and beheaded the other shop-owner that very night and brought the harp, that he had won, to his fair lady bard.~
@536  = ~She took the harp with a great cry of joy and began to play it, ignoring the warrior who had gone to all the trouble to retrieve it for her. Finally, however, his patience was at an end, and he demanded her attention. She coldly replied that she could never love him, because he was a warrior and she was against such things, but she was happy with his gift and would remember him fondly.~
@537  = ~Ha ha! What wit! She played the warrior even better than the harp, I dare say! What happened then?~
@538  = ~He was so enthralled by grief and rage at being spurned that he raped her then cut out her heart and left the harp in her lifeless hands. Tales of his travels follow after that, as he felt grief at his loss of control and wandered the land in repentance until his death years later, doing good deeds when and where he could.~
@539  = ~I see the meaning behind this story, dear hawk. You wish to be romanced by this humble bard! All you need do is but speak my name and my heart will be yours and true.~
@540  = ~Ha ha. Actually the meaning of the story is to never trust a bard unless their hearts have been cleft from their chests and they lie lifeless before you, with only their harps living on.~
@541  = ~<CHARNAME>, perhaps you would like to hear a song? Over this way, perhaps... nay a bit further away, my dove...~
@542  = ~Why do you keep looking at me, bard? I grow tired of your stares.~
@543  = ~Bewitched, am I, by thy lovely face and sinfully sensuous form, I fear. I feel I would find paradise trapped in thy strong and passionate embrace.~
@544  = ~Actually you would find death. A painful and brutal one, at that.~
@545  = ~And I would reach Oblivion with great joy in my heart and would feel nothing but pleasure in my passing!~
@546  = ~There is something wrong with you, bard, that you would want to die, especially in such a manner as that.~
@547  = ~We all pass into Oblivion, my dear hawk. What better way to pass than in the arms of a beautiful and savage woman?~
@548  = ~I think you misunderstand, Haer'Dalis. You wouldn't die of over-exertion or whatever your twisted mind has come up with. You'd die because I'd kill you for trying to touch me in such a manner.~
@549  = ~A kiss then, before you end my life, fair hawk. This sparrow is waiting to fly!~
@550  = ~I'm drawing my sword now... steel will be all I kiss you with. Still ready to fly, sparrow?~
@551  = ~You wound me, my hawk. Perhaps I should stay in the back and play songs to rouse your fury onto the enemy... and not myself.~
@552  = ~A wise choice indeed.~
@553  = ~By the gods, bard, if I hear you cry out for Oblivion one more time, I'll end your life myself and be done with it! You endanger all our lives with such suicidal tactics!~
@554  = ~My dear, your interest makes my heart soar with pride and pound with love! Take me into your arms and let us fly together!~
@555  = ~That's it. <CHARNAME>, please tell the bard to go away and never come back. He's endangering our lives and I have no liking of it.~
@556  = ~I agree. Goodbye, Haer'Dalis. You heard the lady. Fly away, little sparrow.~
@557  = ~I'm sorry, Chloe. He stays. I don't think he endangers us any more than any other group member.~
@558  = ~As you wish, it's your call. I don't have to like it, though.~
@559  = ~Fate has kept us together, my hawk! Come, fly with your beloved sparrow! Um... my hawk? Where are you going? You're flying a bit too fast for this sparrow... my hawk?~
@560  = ~If that is your wish than I shall fly away. Should you reconsider this sparrow shall be in the Five Flagons Inn, more than likely.~
@561  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I feel better already. Let us continue on.~
@562  = ~I sing of nightingales and hummingbirds, of starry nights and moonlit strolls...~
@563  = ~... I dream of her hand in mine, and her eyes baring her soul.~
@564  = ~Celeste of Waterdeep, right?~
@565  = ~Yes, very good. You're familiar with her poetry, Imoen?~
@566  = ~Well... yes. I found a book of her poetry in Candlekeep. I found it to be... fascinating.~
@567  = ~Really? We shall have to talk about this in more depth then, my fair Cassima.~
@568  = ~Cassima? The Phoenix star?~
@569  = ~Yes. I think it's a strangely appropriate nickname for you.~
@570  = ~Perhaps you have a point, Luridel. (Grin)~
@571  = ~Luridel?~
@572  = ~You're confusing the poor child, Imoen.~
@573  = ~The Elvish name for Coliar. I've always considered the Elven names for stars to be more... poetic.~
@574  = ~You are so smart, Immy. Gorion would be so proud. (Smile)~
@575  = ~Thank you. Let's talk later, ok? We're straggling behind and <CHARNAME> is giving me a dirty look.~
@576  = ~Jealous, perhaps? Yes, we'll talk later then.~
@577  = ~I've been thinking about what you said the other day...~
@578  = ~You'll have to refresh my memory, Chloe. I say a lot in any given day.~
@579  = ~Yes, I've noticed. (smiles) I was referring to your childhood, though.~
@580  = ~What about it?~
@581  = ~Well, <CHARNAME> has told me a little about <PRO_HISHER> childhood, but I'm interested in yours now.~
@582  = ~Oh, ok. Well, like <CHARNAME> probably told you, we grew up together in Candlekeep.~
@583  = ~Though I came later on... <CHARNAME> was very young when Gorion took <pro_himher> in. I was about 10 when I became Gorion's ward.~
@584  = ~Oh? Where did you live before that?~
@585  = ~Oh I... um... actually I don't remember. I asked Gorion a few times, but he never really answered me straight-out so I figured it wasn't important.~
@586  = ~But now you have me wondering. It's too bad too, because I can't exactly ask Gorion now.~
@587  = ~Perhaps another means of discovering your origins, besides your newfound Bhaal-parentage?~
@588  = ~Yes... we'll have to put some thought into it and see if we can discover a means for me to find out.~
@589  = ~I'll help as much as I am able. I know how it is to be unsure of one's beginnings.~
@590  = ~Thanks, Chloe. We'll talk about it more tonight when we make camp.~
@591  = ~Did you enjoy watching me practice, Imoen?~
@592  = ~Yes, I don't think I've ever seen anyone quite as skilled as you are before.~
@593  = ~I'm insulted, ye damned lanky pale-skinned beardless overtall stinkin' pile of...~
@594  = ~There's always someone better out there. The quest for self-perfection is endless and grueling.~
@595  = ~Which brings up a question I've been meaning to ask you. Your mother was Akadia, goddess of the air, correct?~
@596  = ~Yes. What about it?~
@597  = ~But you worship Lathandar and not your mother. May I ask why?~
@598  = ~Your father was Bhaal. Do you worship him?~
@599  = ~Bhaal was an evil god. Besides, he's dead. Even if he weren't, I could never worship such as he.~
@600  = ~I don't believe in evil. But that's a conversation for another day.~
@601  = ~Yes. Now back to my question, and please give me your reasoning, and not ask for mine. (Smile)~
@602  = ~Of course. My self-improvement and body are in honor of Lathandar. My skills and my battles honor Akadia. I worship both, in a manner of speaking.~
@603  = ~How so? I'm intrigued.~
@604  = ~My practices are dedicated to Lathandar, to honor him. But when I pray, or when I battle, I call upon Akadia.~
@605  = ~Lathandar is the god of self-perfection and skill, but Akadia's is the power behind my sword-strokes.~
@606  = ~I don't really understand.~
@607  = ~I.. I think I do. I worship Baervar Wildwanderer but Aerdrie Faenya will always be revered in my heart.~
@608  = ~I didn't think you would. Tell you what, tomorrow night when I practice, practice with me. You'll understand when your mind becomes clear and your body moves on it's own.~
@609  = ~I... I'd like that. I'll be looking forward to it. Good night.~
@610  = ~So why do you think Bhaal was an evil god?~
@611  = ~He was the god of murder! What is more evil than murder?!~
@612  = ~In my experience, death can be as much a blessing as a bane. Calculated cruelty can be far worse than simple death. Everyone dies, after all.~
@613  = ~True. But murder for the sake of murder isn't evil to you?~
@614  = ~I don't believe in evil. Or good. So it's a moot point.~
@615  = ~How can you not believe in good and evil? You're a good person. I'd like to think I am as well.~
@616  = ~I'm a selfless person because I was raised to believe my life will end sooner rather than later. I can afford to be altruistic. What possible reason could I have to be selfish?~
@617  = ~To gain power, money, respect?~
@618  = ~I can't take all that with me when I die. When Grandmother Death takes me by the hand, all I'll have is the knowledge that every day I was the best person I could be, and every day after that I was a little better. That has nothing to do with goodness. Altruism makes one feel good, so it is itself a selfish pursuit. Goodness implies there is no selfish gain, thus it does not exist.~
@619  = ~What about doing the right thing even if it hurts you, and possibly the ones you love?~
@620  = ~I'm assuming you mean what is best for the masses over the few. You have to let your instincts guide you in those situations. You don't do it because you're a good person or a bad person. You do it because you feel it's the best course of action. A noble and fulfilled life is one that you can look back on and realize you wouldn't have done a single thing differently.~
@621  = ~There are lots of things I wish I hadn't gone through. This whole business with Irenicus and Bodhi, for example.~
@622  = ~Of course the results of our actions are often not what we hoped or expected, but would you go back in time and leave <CHARNAME>'s side had you known your soul would be ripped from your body? Had you known you would have been captured and tortured?~
@623  = ~...... No.~
@624  = ~Why? Because you're a good person?~
@625  = ~No... because I love <CHARNAME>. And I would walk beside <PRO_HIMHER> no matter where it led.~
@626  = ~So ultimately, it's because of a selfish reason. Because you feel better when you're with <CHARNAME>. Because <CHARNAME> gives you comfort and love. Because you prefer your life with <CHARNAME> rather than what it would be without <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@627  = ~... I see your point. You've given me much to think about. We'll talk more on this later, ok?~
@628  = ~Any time, nightingale.~
@629  = ~Ready to continue our conversation, nightingale?~
@630  = ~Yes. I just don't buy that there is no good and evil. Not every action is motivated by selfish desires.~
@631  = ~Oh? Have you an example?~
@632  = ~Love. Love isn't selfish.~
@633  = ~I must disagree. Love is the most selfish of all. What other than love demands so much attention and care?~
@634  = ~Perhaps, but it also leads to the most selfless of all actions. The total surrendering of oneself to another. Making oneself totally vulnerable to another. How can that be selfish?~
@635  = ~You really believe love involves that? Not just the selfish desire to be close to someone and have them care for you?~
@636  = ~If it were, how would you explain unrequited love? How about risking oneself or even sacrificing oneself for a loved one?~
@637  = ~Selfishly protecting one's self-interests, perhaps. I have no direct experience with love though, so I can't speak from experience. How about yourself?~
@638  = ~... What?~
@639  = ~Have you ever been in love?~
@640  = ~I don't... um... hey we need to catch up to the others.~
@641  = ~Hmm... intriguing. (smiles)~
@642  = ~A copper for your thoughts, Imoen?~
@643  = ~I was thinking about what you were saying about love.~
@644  = ~Any conclusions?~
@645  = ~Well, I have a question. Do you think true unselfish love exists?~
@646  = ~Well... I don't think love involves only selfish motivations. There is obviously the unselfish giving of oneself to another involved, after all.~
@647  = ~Yes?~
@648  = ~But there's nothing wrong with the selfish aspects of love either. One must always be mindful of what one wants and pursue it. Especially if what one wants is love.~
@649  = ~I suppose so. Love does have a tendency to breed need. But I think it would be nice to need someone like that.~
@650  = ~Perhaps. There is something to be said for simple want as well, though. Like you, for instance.~
@651  = ~What? Um... what about me?~
@652  = ~I want you, Imoen. You fascinate me. Will you join me in my bedding tonight, away from the eyes of the others?~
@653  = ~Wow... that's very forward of you.~
@654  = ~Does it offend you?~
@655  = ~A little, yes.~
@656  = ~Hmm. I apologize. Is it because I am a woman, or because you don't feel the same way about me that I feel about you?~
@657  = ~Hey! Don't say it like that. I have no problems with having feelings for you, despite, because of, or regardless of your feminity!~
@658  = ~So...~
@659  = ~I'm not accustomed to being asked to sleep with someone. Especially not with someone I haven't known for very long.~
@660  = ~I'm not asking for your hand in marriage, my nightingale. I'm asking you to share my bed tonight. If you're uncomfortable with lovemaking, we can simply hold each other and be close.~
@661  = ~Oh... well... alright. No promises though. Oh... <CHARNAME> is looking at me. I'm so embarrassed. Haha. Well let's give <PRO_HIMHER> a shock! I'll join you tonight.~
@662  = ~Good morning, nightingale.~
@663  = ~Mmmmh. (yawns) Good morning, hummingbird. Oh... (giggles) <CHARNAME> is giving me a most peculiar look!~
@664  = ~Hmm... may I ask you a question?~
@665  = ~Sure, be my guest.~
@666  = ~Were you and <CHARNAME> ever... more than friends?~
@667  = ~Hmm... what? Well, we grew up together. We're like siblings...~
@668  = ~Ok, but were you ever... romantic?~
@669  = ~Hmm. I'd rather not talk about my youthful experiments right now, especially within earshot of the others.~
@670  = ~Later then? All the naughty details of your sordid past?~
@671  = ~Haha... only if I get the same.~
@672  = ~Deal, my nightingale. <CHARNAME> is starting to look a bit impatient, so let's pack up our things and be away, shall we?~
@673  = ~Hummingbird, have you ever thought about settling down or having children?~
@674  = ~Children? Possibly. Settling down? I don't know. Stay in a particular area perhaps, but I can't foresee putting my sword down as long as I draw breath.~
@675  = ~Would you if the one you loved asked you to?~
@676  = ~Do you think the one I love would ask me to choose between my god and goddess, my people's culture and beliefs, and entire way of life, or her?~
@677  = ~Always a possibility.~
@678  = ~Hmm. I haven't reached that point of love yet, so I really can't say for sure. Perhaps in the grip of deep love I wouldn't even have to consider it?~
@679  = ~Perhaps.~
@680  = ~How about yourself?~
@681  = ~Me? Haha... I'll never settle down. I spent my youth in Candlekeep burning with the desire to get into the world and see it, to adventure and leave my mark on it.~
@682  = ~And if your beloved asked you to settle down, would you?~
@683  = ~Not a chance. But my beloved would fall in love with me with full knowledge that I'll never settle down, so it'll be her choice whether she wants to stay with me or not.~
@684  = ~Or um.... him. (blush) Hey, is that a spotted hawk? Let me go check it out... ... ...~
@685  = ~That last battle we were in... I was very scared when I saw you get hurt.~
@686  = ~I can take care of myself, Chloe.~
@687  = ~I know. But still...~
@688  = ~Let's talk about this later, alright?~
@689  = ~... Alright.~
@690  = ~Nightingale, are you not joining me in my bedding tonight?~
@691  = ~I'm... not in the mood tonight, ok?~
@692  = ~We can simply sleep beside each other, keep each other warm. The night air gets so cold sometimes...~
@693  = ~Sleep closer to the fire then.~
@694  = ~... Is something bothering you, Imoen? You can talk to me you know...~
@695  = ~I'd rather not tonight. Look I'll compromise, I'll set my bedding down next to yours, ok? Good night.~
@696  = ~Good night.~
@697  = ~<CHARNAME>, can we talk a moment?~
@698  = ~Of course, what's on your mind?~
@699  = ~Not now. Maybe later.~
@700  = ~Leave me alone, brat.~
@701  = ~What's your problem? Sheesh... fine, I'll leave you alone. You really hurt my feelings, though.~
@702  = ~Alright... I guess. Sorry to bother you.~
@703  = ~Do you think it's dangerous for me to fall in love with Chloe?~
@704  = ~No, I don't think it's dangerous at all. Are you having doubts?~
@705  = ~Well... strange maybe, but not dangerous.~
@706  = ~Yes, dangerous is an understatement. She's bad news. Do you want me to kick her out of the party?~
@707  = ~Dangerous and sick. What's wrong with you, Imoen!?~
@708  = ~I had hoped you'd be a little more supportive. Whether you like my relationship with Chloe or not, I thought you cared about ME at least. Fine then, just ignore us. You really hurt my feelings though, <CHARNAME>. I pity you. When you're more in the mood to be the big <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> that you CLAIM to be, let me know, ok? Till then, stay out of my business.~
@709  = ~No! Please... don't do that. I'll just see where things go. Gotta try, right? Thanks for the offer though.~
@710  = ~I suppose it is a little strange. Your little sister falling for someone, huh? haha I bet you never thought you'd see the day. But she doesn't seem the type to fall in love though.~
@711  = ~Are you kidding? She'd have to be blind, deaf, and an idiot to not fall for you, sis. Don't worry about it so much.~
@712  = ~Perhaps you're right. If you wanted to get out without causing too many hurt feelings, now would be the time.~
@713  = ~Well, if that's the case just enjoy the sex while it lasts and end the relationship when you no longer feel comfortable, eh? (grin)~
@714  = ~You should end things now then. Why prolong the inevitable?~
@715  = ~(sighs) Maybe. I think I have to give this a shot, though. Thanks, <CHARNAME>.~
@716  = ~Haha you're a nut, <CHARNAME>. I'll keep that in mind.~
@717  = ~I know... but I have to give it a shot. Thanks for the advice, though.~
@718  = ~Thanks. I think I just needed a little reassurement.~
@719  = ~Well... perhaps. She doesn't seem the type to fall in love, so I'm scared to fall for her... but I don't think I can help it. (sigh)~
@720  = ~Well, I'm sure you'll make the right decision, little sister. Just follow your heart.~
@721  = ~Perhaps you should stay away from her then, Imoen?~
@722  = ~Thanks big <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. I feel better already.~
@723  = ~No... I think it's worth giving it a shot. If I get burned, at least I'd have given it a shot. Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I feel better already.~
@724  = ~Ok, what is it, Nightingale? You've been giving me strange looks all day.~
@725  = ~Are you sure you want to know, Chloe?~
@726  = ~This sounds serious. Yes, please tell me what's on your mind?~
@727  = ~Well... I'm not quite sure how to tell you this... but... here goes...~
@728  = ~I'm pregnant. (rests hand on her tummy)~
@729  = ~Oh my... c-congratulations!~
@730  = ~Wh... wh...... what?! I mean... whoa... how?! I mean... the divine essence maybe there's something... oh gods... you're pregnant?! Oh gods! Oh... I'm so sorry! Is this... are you... are you ok with this!? I mean... I guess you have to be... but are... oh my... I had no idea this could happen!~
@731  = ~(laughs)~
@732  = ~What's so funny?! I'm sorry I'm reacting so badly... oh my.... I'm in shock...~
@733  = ~How did... damned divinity! My mother could have warned me... oh my...~
@734  = ~Chloe.~
@735  = ~Huh?~
@736  = ~I'm teasing you. Oh... you should have seen the look on your face!~
@737  = ~What? So you're not...~
@738  = ~No.~
@739  = ~Oh. Well... that's... good. Right? I mean... is it?~
@740  = ~Yes. I'm not ready for a child. And by your reaction I know you're not either. We'll discuss it in the future, ok?~
@741  = ~Well... most likely it is impos...~
@742  = ~Don't say impossible. We don't know. We'll worry about it in the future. Together.~
@743  = ~Yes... together. I like that.~
@744  = ~Good. Because I'm not letting you go, Hummingbird. You're MINE now.~
@745  = ~(grins) Yes. Yes I am. And don't you forget it.~
@746  = ~You make it sound like no one has a choice in their lot in life. For some the choice may be limited, but there is always a choice.~
@747  = ~I hope that doesn't involve anything... intimate, Minsc. I doubt Aerie would appreciate such overtures.~
@748  = ~I care not for being insulted behind my back, squire. You receive the respect you give, and right now you are barely worth being allowed to lick the dirt off my boots.~
@749  = ~And I care not for your nose in my business, wench! Quiet yourself when you are not being spoken to. My words were to <CHARNAME> and to <PRO_HIMHER> alone!~
@750  = ~Perhaps you should take that as a hint then, Anomen. I doubt she has any more interest in you than your contributions to the group.~
@751  = ~Perhaps that is so, Chloe, but I prefer hearing such things from <CHARNAME> herself. If you wish to converse with me, then do so later. Now, <CHARNAME>, do you wish to hear of my travels?~
@752  = ~So even your own sister could not stand your temper. I am not surprised. Even still, she sounds like a very special girl.~
@753  = ~Evil... impulses... too... strong. Must... kill knight weighed down by heavy armor... Akadia's blood... demands it!~
@754  = ~Quiet, woman. My words were not to you, and I find your mockery most infuriating! My lady <CHARNAME>, please ignore this insolent wench and continue with what you were about to say?~
@755  = ~Oh how revolting. <CHARNAME>, surely you don't want to kiss this pompous hairy fool, do you!?~
@756  = ~Quiet, wench! I'll not have your meddling in my affairs! Turn your cow eyes upon some other poor maiden and leave <CHARNAME> in peace!~
@757  = ~I understand why you ask her to close her eyes. Better she not see your face close up, or she might lose her lunch. Oh, I can't watch!~
@758  = ~That does not surprise me in the least.~
@759  = ~Don't go with him, <CHARNAME>. Anomen just wants into your britches. Surely you find the notion as repugnant as I?~
@760  = ~I would say so, but perhaps she is actually falling for your lines. Miracles do happen, I am told. <CHARNAME>? Is this "You are a delicate flower, bow before my manly presense and prepare to be mounted" h'archa actually working on you?~
@761  = ~Chloe, I would ask that you desist in your mockery of my feelings. I will only ask once. Let not your jealousy poison your words. <CHARNAME>, have I indeed overstepped myself?~
@762  = ~Chloe, no matter my intentions, they are between <CHARNAME> and myself. She has not taken too many knocks to the head that she cannot decide for herself what she will do. I thank you for staying out of our affairs, Chloe. Now, will you accompany me, my lady <CHARNAME>?~
@763  = ~And if your spell happens to hit me, you'll be dead before you draw your next breath. I could care less if your spell happens to singe the halfling's hair, though.~
@764  = ~Your concern for my well-being touches me, Chloe. Were I as callous as yourself, I might ignore such an attack on you as well. But as your luck would have it, I actually have a heart.~
@765  = ~Aerie, it's not your fault that Jaheira's hair is ratty and dull. Not everyone can have silky blonde locks like you or lovely red hair like mine.~
@766  = ~(Giggle) Chloe, I... I didn't say that Jaheira's hair was ratty!~
@767  = ~Chloe, keep your comments about my hair to yourself. And as for you...~
@768  = ~Excuse me, halfling? We should be slaughtering any enemies that we make before they even know we have become their enemies. We should not be making enemies as if each were a badge of honor. Keep making enemies for the sake of enemies and you'll find yourself on the battlefield alone.~
@769  = ~Oh, how simply noble of you. Pardon me whilst I wretch.~
@770  = ~Foolhardy? Hah, for him perhaps. (Chuckle)~
@771  = ~My guess is you're here to heal our wounds and help kill our enemies. Beyond that, I think <CHARNAME> wants to bed you. Whether he listens to your incessant prattling is his choice.~
@772  = ~(Sigh) That's what he does, Minsc. Confuses friend and foe alike with pointless metaphors.~
@773  = ~I don't like the looks of this guy. I say we either kill him or leave him here to rot.~
@774  = ~Jaheira, I sympathize with your loss. Please, take a few moments to come to grips with your pain, lest you lash out at friends.~
@775  = ~Shut up! You are a stranger! You are not my friend! The one who is most precious to me is gone!~
@776  = ~Another damned vampire! We should kill it, before it turns its attack on us!~
@777  = ~Idiot! Don't you recognize me? I came down here with you all to fight against this rival guild.~
@778  = ~We shouldn't get involved then. Let the wizards handle it. No reason to stick our necks out here.~
@779  = ~You may as well. We can kill it in seconds if it's stupid enough to attack, sword or no. You went to all the trouble to get it anyway, and those peasants were monsters in disguise. Nothing is as it seems here, it would seem.~
@780  = ~Wow... what a beautiful young elf you have become. <CHARNAME>, this may only be my hormones talking here, but I say we take this lovely elf with us. (Grin)~
@781  = ~I have never heard an ogre talk in such a way as this. I think there is more than meets the eye here. Kill it though, if you think caution is the wisest course.~
@782  = ~No, we killed you because you attacked us, worm. Now you know the folly of opposing a Yr'kai!~
@783  = ~Greetings to you, my <BROTHERSISTER>, and welcome to a refuge for the suffering and those in need.  Ilmater offers shelit-- uh, sharlt...~
@784  = ~Um... hold on. Sorry, this is my first day. The previous priest was apparently scared off by this wild barbarian woman. The nerve of some people! Let me try again...~
@785  = ~I swear if he says 'coo' one more time, I'll remove his spleen. He'd best be telling us what we want to know without any further stalling.~
@786  = ~You think that 20000 is an outrageous sum, <CHARNAME>? My... how long have you been adventuring?~
@787  = ~Hey! You there! Barbarian lady!~
@788  = ~You are not referring to me, are you? I'll skin you alive if you ever call me that again, whelp.~
@789  = ~Er... no problem! See this mighty fine sphere here? 500 gold pieces and it's yours!~
@790  = ~And what would I do with such a sphere? I am a warrior, not a s'lehuk.~
@791  = ~Um... start a stronghold? I don't know. It's not my problem! Do you wanna buy it or not?~
@792  = ~If I wanted it I'd just take it. I need not deal with you at all, unless you got in my way.~
@793  = ~... You, you over there! See this sphere behind me?~
@794  = ~That man is slimier than an earthworm. I wonder what these 'other entertainments' are, though.~
@795  = ~We really shouldn't get involved in this. I despise the slave trade but it's not our problem, and we'd only call the wrath of the slavers on our heads. It's too much trouble.~
@796  = ~We may as well strike the slavers down before they learn of our involvement here and take measures to kill us. Kill our enemies before they even know we oppose them, and all that. You really like getting involved in everyone's problems though, you know that?~
@797  = ~Hello you fiery haired goddess! I am Salvanas and I find myself enflamed by your aching beauty!~
@798  = ~How special for you.~
@799  = ~Er... yes! A special night of passion wrapped in your hot and tight embrace!~
@800  = ~I'm not interested, ok slick?~
@801  = ~That's er... Salvanas. But I would love to make you nice and...~
@802  = ~If you finish that sentence you'll be wearing your bowels on top of your head.~
@803  = ~(Cough) Barkeep, another drink please... quickly!~
@804  = ~Now this is a worthy quest. Aiding a noble is almost always advantageous. And such a fetching one at that. I hope you can take care of yourself though, Lady Nalia, because we can only do so much to watch your back.~
@805  = ~We're not hiding, foul creature. We're here to chop you up into bite sized chunks and roast you to feed to the dogs! Cower before the might of a Yr'kai!~
@806  = ~Nalia, I've met some conceited nobles in my time, but I dare say your aunt could stand a good spanking to better her attitude.~
@807  = ~Such a refreshing turn to see such passion from you, Nalia. I'm sorry you've had to put up with such an oaf. Do you want me to kill him for you?~
@808  = ~Would you? Oh... forget I said that. Ha ha... he's an arrogant bastard but even he doesn't deserve to die.~
@809  = ~Hah, <CHARNAME> might not attack you, but I can have you clutching your neck to stem your lifeblood and half your guards dead before the other half can even blink. Give me the word, <CHARNAME>...~
@810  = ~What a despicable wretch. <CHARNAME>, we cannot let this fiend whisk away our allies! Perhaps it was best not to go with the outright violent response, but surely you're planning on quietly assassinating him and rescuing Nalia? This Isaea deserves no less. He has proven to be our enemy.~
@811  = ~I saw far worse by the time I was ten winters old. But it would be advantageous for us to deal with this murderer. This is a little too sick for my tastes.~
@812  = ~Rose? What are you doing?~
@813  = ~Eh? Chloe? My my... I haven't seen you in years. I'm providing a service to lonely men, that's all.~
@814  = ~Why aren't you with your sister, Lily?~
@815  = ~Oh, she got married to this respectable merchant fellow. She started seeing him not too long after you two parted ways.~
@816  = ~A fellow? Oh...~
@817  = ~Don't fret none, honey. Now, did you all want something other than a chat?~
@818  = ~Well, it would be nice to have such a lovely creature in our party, but on the other hand people will be less friendly with a Drow in the party. Though that other Drow certainly gained respect, I don't see why Viconia can't as well. Do what you think best, <CHARNAME>.~
@819  = ~Well, it wasn't pleasant paying off those greedy controlling dehr'jiith, but at least our mages can cast a spell without us worrying about a horde of mages suddenly attacking us.~
@820  = ~Wolves? I doubt it. Ogres? Laughable. A dead witch? No... I'm willing to bet it's a sinister mage, or a group of mages. Probably performing experiments on people, or some such.~
@821  = ~We don't need the help of this little munchkin. Leave the little bit here. She can get out on her own. I don't care for her attitude.~
@822  = ~Oh please. A stab in its monstrous eye and maybe a spell or two, and it'll go down sure enough. Beholders are powerful, but not omnipotent. Let's just slaughter the cultists and the beholder and forget all this rod nonsense.~
@823  = ~Oh this is ridiculous! We should just charge in, slaughter the weak-minded blind fools, go down into the beast's layer, grab the rod piece, and blast this bloated jar'crith into the abyss! There's no reason for all this sneaking around kah'suth!~
@824  = ~Well, if it isn't Chloe the wonder girl returning to stand before Renal Bloodscalp. Whattaya know?~
@825  = ~Wonder girl indeed. I believe you owe me some money, Renal.~
@826  = ~Pardon? I think not, girlie. I lost so many of my thieves that night. It did not even approach being a successful night!~
@827  = ~Not my problem. I completed the task you assigned me, therefore you owe me what we agreed upon.~
@828  = ~You can have a thousand gold coins and not a copper more than.~
@829  = ~You owe me 3000 coins, not a thousand.~
@830  = ~Perhaps I was unclear... you'll take a thousand or you'll get nothing at all!~
@831  = ~You'll pay me the 3000 or I'll slaughter every last one of your thieves and leave you hanging on the wall impaled by my sword while I gather up as much gold as I can carry.~
@832  = ~Then I'll leave you to bleed to death while I spend the coin on fine wine, great music, and lovely women.~
@833  = ~Eh... 2500 was it?~
@834  = ~3000. Pay up or it'll double.~
@835  = ~(Grumble) Here's your blasted gold. Threaten me again and you'll find a blade in your back when you least expect it.~
@836  = ~Pleasure doing business with you, shorty.~
@837  = ~(Grunts and turns to stare at you)~
@838  = ~Bah, I don't like this. Who knows what kind of jobs this Mae'var will send us on? We have nothing to gain here but a bit of coin, but we'll be placing ourselves in the middle of a thieves' civil war. Not a favorable position by any measure. Just forget about this job, <CHARNAME>, it's just not worth the trouble.~
@839  = ~I don't really have a problem with killing some wizard, but I don't really care for the one having us do it. Do we really have to jump through this mageling's hoops?~
@840  = ~Oh, just great. Now the arrogant wizard wants to join us. I think his loyalties change far too easily for us to trust him at our backs.~
@841  = ~One less thief in the world I suppose. I wonder what petty crime he committed against Mae'Var? Perhaps he looked at him the wrong way, or failed to kiss Mae'Var's boots.~
@842  = ~Your future is filled with darkness and bloodshed. You will suffer a greater loss than you can imagine, but in so doing so you will find your only hope.~
@843  = ~A great loss? I shall watch for it then and hope that your vision is false. What will be, will be, however.~
@844  = ~Logan? You old dog, you! The last time I saw you, we were guarding Lord Jawthi of Brookehaven on his way to his wedding!~
@845  = ~Chloe? It's good to see a familiar face. I feel even better now that I see you are amongst these people. I know you to be a good and honorable woman. Now, your companion here looks as if <PRO_HESHE> has a question or two for me.~
@846  = ~Ah, Chloe. It is good to see you again. I see you accompany this group that I've been hearing so much about.~
@847  = ~Yes, Aran. Now, shall we discuss our business? You should talk to <CHARNAME> though, it is with <PRO_HIMHER> that your business is with, after all.~
@848  = ~Yes, yes of course. Greetings, <CHARNAME>.~
@849  = ~Oh so good of you to placate us with your trinkets while you delay us from Imoen's rescue, s'lehuk.~
@850  = ~If he does not stay true to his word, I swear by my gods that he will die a gruesome and painful death.~
@851  = ~How many more damned hoops are we going to jump through, Aran? I grow impatient.~
@852  = ~I relish the challenge. Now make it so and quit trying to dissuade us so you don't have to hold up your end of the bargain.~
@853  = ~Aran, you tread on dangerous ground here. We have not paid that money to become your errand runners! Must I threaten you to hasten the process?~
@854  = ~Bodhi... I have heard this name before. I'm not sure where, however. I recommend you use caution with this one. Something about her sends a chill up my spine.~
@855  = ~There is no doubt now that this woman is a vampire. <CHARNAME>, she would just as soon drain your blood for a snack as to make good on her end of the bargain. I recommend you don't trust her. Vampires are powerful but they're far too unpredictable to make good allies. Also, I really hate them.~
@856  = ~Well that isn't too bad, but I am sure things will get worse. When we return we will have to walk into the belly of the beast, but now we have no choice in that matter. I hope you have not made the wrong decision, my friend.~
@857  = ~I have done both kinds of jobs in the past but I would prefer doing the one that will allow the rest of you to sleep soundly. But choose however you like, either way we are doing this gor'hlahk's bidding.~
@858  = ~It had better or you'll be the next to die, jar'crith. This I promise you.~
@859  = ~Your brother!? Jon Irenicus... Bodhi... so familiar. I have heard something of this... ah... a possible answer. Ignore me, <CHARNAME>, my theories are not worth mentioning. Go on, vampire gor'hlahk.~
@860  = ~So send the surfacers against a creature that has slaughtered many of your best warriors already for the promise to tell us how to get to a creature that may or may not help us? Kah'suth! Typical munchkin dehr'jiiths.~
@861  = ~Is it me or did that sound a bit like 'Sucker!'?~
@862  = ~Oh, let us bow and scrape our knees on the ground for the great dragon has spoken and we lowly beings must obey! Jar'crith, I would sooner gut you than allow you to speak to me thus. You seek our help, I suggest you remain civil.~
@863  = ~So for a trinket we storm into a Drow stronghold to retrieve some eggs because this beast was too incompetant to protect them in the first place?~
@864  = ~I wouldn't be so quick to trust this monster. Dragons have a tendancy to eat people once they have done their bidding. I don't care how noble this gor'hlahk claims to be, we still cannot trust her. However, I don't see much choice, unless we can find our own route to the surface and bypass the Drow city altogether...~
@865  = ~Though I can't force you to help release this genie, I do think it is advantageous for you to anyway, since he has something of yours that he can't give you while he is bound. It is up to you, however.~
@866  = ~Grae'kae'ith! There is no greater offense than betraying your allies! I will slice you from navel to chin and tear your guts out with my bare hands! I will...~
@867  = ~Aran Linvail, why am I not surprised? I have had dealings with him in the past. For what it is worth, I think you made the best choice of allies.~
@868  = ~Lucy?! By the gods, woman, I knew you were a beast, but a wyvern!? Are you spying on me again?! Hey... don't ignore me! Argh... stupid creature.~
@869  = ~Whoa! <CHARNAME>, I don't particularly care for your faith but I had no real problems with it until now.~
@870  = ~Worship how you please, but if you attack the temple of Lathandar, you will fight me as well. I will not turn a blind eye as you slaughter the followers of my god. Make your choice.~
@871  = ~You are right, I cannot follow through with this order. Glorifying Talos is one thing, but destroying an entire temple of another god? That is just suicide.~
@872  = ~I must bring glory to Talos, and all who stand in my way shall perish! Oppose me if you must, I am going to slaughter everyone in Lathander's temple as Talos watches!~
@873  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Let's get out of here.~
@874  = ~I see. Then you leave me no choice but to end your life here and now. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@875  = ~Oh, so that's where you were last night, <CHARNAME>. I must say, I'm a bit jealous.~
@876  = ~Oh my, I... I didn't mean to cause problems between you two! There's nothing to be jealous of.~
@877  = ~Well, I am jealous. Why have I never been asked to share your bedroll? I can keep you just as warm as she can, you know.~
@878  = ~Oh, I don't mind at all! Just as long as you don't steal the blankets.~
@879  = ~Good, I'm sure <CHARNAME> won't mind a bit. (Grin)~
@880  = ~J-jealous? If you wanted to share my bedroll, all you had to do was ask.~
@881  = ~Oh? Intriguing... I would be glad to help keep you warm at night then, my dear.~
@882  = ~Good, just... just don't steal the blankets!~
@883  = ~Goodness, Aerie. Such a statement... but if that's all it takes, I promise that I will never steal your covers... especially when the night gets cold.~
@884  = ~And that is why you are always welcome to sleep in my bedroll, Chloe.~
@885  = ~Wow... I'm speechless. I would be happy to keep you warm and for some reason I feel I would be struck down by the gods if I tried anything more...~
@886  = ~Anything more than what?~
@887  = ~... So, do you prefer the left side or the right? Or does it matter? Oh, and pass the water please.~
@888  = ~Indeed it is, Aerie. And might I say the sunset makes you look especially beautiful?~
@889  = ~(Blush) Oh my... thank you, Chloe. It also brings out the highlights in your hair. Share a sweetroll with me?~
@890  = ~I'd love to, thank you.~
@891  = ~I think, perhaps, you misheard the fair Aerie, dear bard. *I* heard...~
@892  = ~Thank the gods, Immy. I was so worried about you.~
@893  = ~Aw... gimme a hug, Hummingbird. Thank you for standing by me. And now, <CHARNAME>...~
@894  = ~Aw... that's sweet of you for worrying about your new little sis, Chloe. Thanks. <CHARNAME>...~
@895  = ~Gahj ne hcharuk... my very essence was being pulled apart. I was staring Death in the eye and defying her with my last strength of will. Then I felt as if I were yanked backwards and... I stand here with you in hell. What... what have I done? Is this... my punishment for defying death? Fine then, <CHARNAME>, I stand beside you still, even in death. Lead us deeper into the abyss.~
@896  = ~We shall paint this accursed place with your foul blood, mage! You will die for all that you have done! This I swear by my gods and my very soul!~
@897  = ~You scared the neh'ka out of us, <CHARNAME>... We shall see you through this, but try not to turn into a monster and attack us again. It's bad for our health. (Nervous smile)~
